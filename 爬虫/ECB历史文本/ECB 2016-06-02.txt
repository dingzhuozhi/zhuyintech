At today’s meeting, which was held in Vienna, the Governing Council of the ECB decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively.
Regarding non-standard monetary policy measures, on 8 June the Eurosystem will start making purchases under its corporate sector purchase programme (CSPP). Moreover, starting on 22 June, it will conduct the first operation in its new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations. Further information on implementation aspects of the CSPP will be released after the press conference on the ECB’s website.
The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today.
