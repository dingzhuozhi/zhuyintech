20130122," 1 January 22, 2013 Bank of Japan  Introduction of the ""Price Stability Target"" and the ""Open-Ended Asset Purchasing Method""  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan took additional steps to provide monetary accommodation decisively.  Specifically, the Bank decided to (1) introduce the ""price stability target,"" and (2) introduce the ""open-ended asset purchasing method"" (i.e., to purchase assets without setting any termination date) under the Asset Purchase Program.  Furthermore, the Bank decided to release the joint statement with the Government. (1) Introduction of the ""price stability target""1 The Bank held the discussion concerning its thinking on price stability and decided to introduce the ""price stability target.""  In addition, the Bank decided to release ""The 'Price Stability Target' under the Framework for the Conduct of Monetary Policy"" (see Attachment 1). The Bank recognizes that the inflation rate consistent with price stability on a sustainable basis will rise as efforts by a wide range of entities toward strengthening competitiveness and growth potential of Japan's economy make progress.  Based on this recognition, the Bank sets the price stability target at 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI). Under the price stability target specified above, the Bank will pursue monetary easing and aim to achieve this target at the earliest possible time.  Taking into consideration that it will take considerable time before the effects of monetary policy permeate the economy, the Bank will ascertain whether there is any significant risk to the sustainability of economic growth, including from the accumulation of financial imbalances.   2 (2) Introduction of the ""open-ended asset purchasing method""2 The Bank will pursue aggressive monetary easing, aiming to achieve the above-mentioned price stability target, through a virtually zero interest rate policy and purchases of financial assets, as long as the Bank judges it appropriate to continue with each policy measure respectively.3, 4  With respect to the Asset Purchase Program, after completing the current purchasing method, from January 2014, the Bank will introduce a method of purchasing a certain amount of financial assets every month without setting any termination date.  Particularly, for some time, following the introduction of this method, the amount of monthly purchases is specified at about 13 trillion yen, 2 trillion yen of which is JGBs (see Attachment 2 for the purchases of financial assets).  As a result of these measures, the total size of the Asset Purchase Program will be increased by about 10 trillion yen in 2014 and is expected to be maintained thereafter.  In the pursuit of monetary easing, taking into consideration that it will take considerable time before the effects of monetary policy permeate the economy, the Bank will ascertain whether there is any significant risk to the sustainability of economic growth, including from the accumulation of financial imbalances. (3) Joint statement of the Government and the Bank of Japan5 The Bank decided to release the statement titled ""Joint Statement of the Government and the Bank of Japan on Overcoming Deflation and Achieving Sustainable Economic Growth"" with the Government (see Attachment 3). 2. The Policy Board also decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period: The Bank of Japan will encourage the uncollateralized overnight call rate to remain at around 0 to 0.1 percent. 3. Overseas economies remain in a deceleration phase.  In global financial markets, investors' risk aversion has abated, although developments require continued attention.   3 4. Japan's economy remains relatively weak.  Exports and industrial production have decreased, reflecting the aforementioned developments in overseas economies.  Business fixed investment has shown some weakness on the whole, although resilience has been observed in nonmanufacturing.  In contrast, public investment has continued to increase, and housing investment has generally been picking up.  Private consumption has remained resilient and the effects of the decline in car sales due to the ending of some measures to stimulate demand for automobiles have diminished.  Meanwhile, financial conditions in Japan are accommodative.  On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is around 0 percent. 5. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is expected to level off more or less for the time being, and thereafter, it will return to a moderate recovery path as domestic demand remains resilient partly due to the effects of various economic measures and overseas economies gradually emerge from the deceleration phase.  For the time being, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to turn negative due to the reversal of the previous year's movements in energy-related and durable consumer goods, and thereafter, it is likely to be around 0 percent again. 6. Compared with the forecasts presented in the October 2012 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices, growth prospects will likely be somewhat lower for fiscal 2012, but they will likely be higher for fiscal 2013 partly due to the effects of various economic measures.  Growth prospects for fiscal 2014 will likely be broadly in line with the October forecasts.  With regard to prices, the year-on-year rate of change in the domestic corporate goods price index will likely be somewhat higher especially for fiscal 2013 mainly due to movements in foreign exchange rates.  The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) will likely be broadly in line with the October forecasts. 7. Regarding risks, there remains a high degree of uncertainty concerning Japan's economy, including the prospects for the European debt problem, the momentum toward recovery for the U.S. economy, the possibility of emerging and commodity-exporting economies making a smooth transition to the sustainable growth path, and the effects of the recent bilateral relationship between Japan and China.   4 8. The Bank recognizes that Japan's economy faces the critical challenge of overcoming deflation as early as possible and returning to the sustainable growth path with price stability.  This challenge will be met through the combination of efforts by a wide range of entities to strengthen the economy's growth potential and support from the financial side.  Based on this recognition, the Bank will, as mentioned above, pursue aggressive monetary easing.  The Bank expects that the Government will surely implement measures, specified in the ""Joint Statement,"" such as carrying out bold regulatory and institutional reforms, and furthermore, steadily promote measures aimed at establishing a sustainable fiscal structure.                                                    1 7-2 majority vote (Voting for the action: Mr. M.

Figures in brackets indicate the median of the Policy Board members' forecasts (point estimates). 2. The forecasts of the majority of the Policy Board members are constructed as follows: each Policy Board member's forecast takes the form of a point estimate -- namely, the figure to which he or she attaches the highest probability of realization. These forecasts are then shown as a range, with the highest figure and the lowest figure excluded. The range does not indicate the forecast errors. 3. Individual Policy Board members make their forecasts with reference to the view of market participants regarding the future course of the policy interest rate -- a view that is incorporated in market interest rates. 4. The scheduled consumption tax hikes for 2014 and 2015 -- of 8 percent and 10 percent, respectively -- are incorporated in the forecasts. In terms of the outlook for the CGPI and the CPI, individual Policy Board members make their forecasts based on figures excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hike. 5. The forecasts for the CGPI and the CPI for fiscal 2014 that incorporate the direct effects of the consumption tax hike are constructed as follows. First, the contribution to prices from the tax hike is mechanically computed on the assumption that the tax increase will be fully passed on for all taxable items. The domestic CGPI will be pushed up by 2.9 percentage points and the CPI by 2.0 percentage points. Second, these figures are added to the forecasts made by the Policy Board members. 6. The CPI using the Chain-Weighted Index Formula has also been released as a reference. Based on this chain-weighted index, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI toward the latter half of the projection period may be slightly lower than the above forecasts based on the Fix-Weighted Index Formula. 7. The ranges shown below include the forecasts of all Policy Board members. y/y % chg.

The Bank of Japan conducts monetary policy based on the principle that the policy shall be aimed at ""achieving price stability, thereby contributing to the sound development of the national economy.""  At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board reviewed the ""price stability goal in the medium to long term"" adopted in February 2012, in light of the above-mentioned principle.  As a result, it decided to introduce the ""price stability target"" and restate the framework for the conduct of monetary policy. 2. ""Price stability"" is defined conceptually as ""a state where various economic agents including households and firms may make decisions regarding such economic activities as consumption and investments without being concerned about the fluctuations in the general price level.""  Therefore, ""price stability"" must be the one on a sustainable basis. 3. The newly-introduced ""price stability target"" is the inflation rate that the Bank judges to be consistent with price stability on a sustainable basis.  The Bank recognizes that the inflation rate consistent with price stability on a sustainable basis will rise as efforts by a wide range of entities toward strengthening competitiveness and growth potential of Japan's economy make progress.  Based on this recognition, the Bank sets the ""price stability target"" at 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) -- a main price index. 4. Previously, the ""price stability goal in the medium to long term"" was in a positive range of 2 percent or lower in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI and the Bank set a goal at 1 percent for the time being.  This time, replacing a ""goal"" with a ""target"" and setting that target at 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change  8 in the CPI are based on the following recognition. The Bank recognizes that the inflation rate consistent with price stability on a sustainable basis will rise as efforts by a wide range of entities toward strengthening competitiveness and growth potential of Japan's economy make progress.  Today's expected rate of inflation has been shaped over the years.  As the strengthening of growth potential makes progress going forward, the actual rate of inflation would gradually rise and accordingly the expected inflation rate of households and firms is likely to rise as well.  Going forward, as prices are expected to rise moderately, it is judged appropriate to clearly indicate the target of 2 percent in order to anchor the sustainable rate of inflation. Switching from a ""goal"" to a ""target"" reflects an increasing awareness regarding the importance of flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy in Japan.  The effects of monetary policy permeating economic activity and thereafter prices require a considerable and variable time lag.  The conduct of monetary policy has to be flexible by examining various risk factors, including those related to financial imbalances, in addition to the assessment of current developments and outlook for economic activity and prices, from the perspective of achieving sustainable growth with price stability.  Such understanding has been widely shared around the globe; particularly, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, major economies of the world have come to emphasize flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy -- by, for example, publicly articulating the importance of paying due attention to financial system stability.  Over the last year, there has been an increasing awareness of such understanding in Japan as well.  In such circumstances, it is judged transparent and appropriate to use the expression, ""target,"" in order to explain the Bank's thinking on price stability. 5. In order for Japan's economy to overcome deflation as early as possible and return to a sustainable growth path with price stability, efforts by a wide range of entities to strengthen growth potential are crucial.  The Bank will continue to thoroughly examine the progress toward strengthening growth potential and the ensuing developments in the expected inflation rate of households and firms.  In the meantime, the Government has shown its intention to aggressively pursue steps for strengthening competitiveness and growth potential of Japan's economy and to steadily promote  9 measures aimed at establishing a sustainable fiscal structure. 6. The Bank will continue to conduct monetary policy, based on its assessment of economic activity and prices from two perspectives, in the context of the ""price stability target."" The first perspective is examining, as regards economic activity and prices over the next two years or so, whether the outlook deemed most likely by the Bank of Japan follows a path of sustainable growth under price stability. The second perspective is examining, in a longer term, various risks that are most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy aimed at achieving sustainable growth under price stability.  In particular, financial imbalances will be examined as a risk that will significantly impact economic activity and prices when they materialize, although the probability of their emergence is low. The Bank of Japan will, in light of deliberations from the two perspectives described above, outline the current view on monetary policy, and disclose it periodically mainly in the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report).   10 Attachment 2  Amount of Monthly Purchases under the Asset Purchase Program from January 2014   Total amount:            about 13 trillion yen JGBs:                                                                                         about 2 trillion yen T-Bills:                                                       about 10 trillion yen   Notes: 1. Based on the average residual maturities of JGBs and T-Bills that have recently been purchased, the total size of the Asset Purchase Program, through the above-mentioned monthly purchases, will be increased by about 10 trillion yen in 2014 and is expected to be maintained thereafter. 2. For financial assets other than JGBs and T-Bills, the Bank will aim to maintain the amount outstanding of those assets. 3. For fixed-rate funds-supplying operation against pooled collateral, the Bank will aim to maintain about 25 trillion yen. 4. In addition to purchases under the program, the Bank regularly purchases JGBs at the pace of 21.6 trillion yen per year.  11 Attachment 3  Joint Statement of the Government and the Bank of Japan on Overcoming Deflation and Achieving Sustainable Economic Growth  1. In order to overcome deflation early and achieve sustainable economic growth with price stability, the Government and the Bank of Japan will strengthen their policy coordination and work together as follows. 2. The Bank of Japan conducts monetary policy based on the principle that the policy shall be aimed at achieving price stability, thereby contributing to the sound development of the national economy, and is responsible for maintaining financial system stability.  The Bank aims to achieve price stability on a sustainable basis, given that there are various factors that affect prices in the short run. The Bank recognizes that the inflation rate consistent with price stability on a sustainable basis will rise as efforts by a wide range of entities toward strengthening competitiveness and growth potential of Japan's economy make progress.  Based on this recognition, the Bank sets the price stability target at 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index. Under the price stability target specified above, the Bank will pursue monetary easing and aim to achieve this target at the earliest possible time.  Taking into consideration that it will take considerable time before the effects of monetary policy permeate the economy, the Bank will ascertain whether there is any significant risk to the sustainability of economic growth, including from the accumulation of financial imbalances. 3. The Government will, in order to revitalize Japan's economy, not only flexibly manage macroeconomic policy but also formulate measures for strengthening competitiveness and growth potential of Japan's economy, and promote them strongly under the leadership of the Headquarters for Japan's Economic Revitalization. Those measures include all possible decisive policy actions for reforming the economic structure, such as concentrating resources on innovative research and development, strengthening the  12 foundation for innovation, carrying out bold regulatory and institutional reforms and better utilizing the tax system. In addition, in strengthening coordination between the Government and the Bank of Japan, the Government will steadily promote measures aimed at establishing a sustainable fiscal structure with a view to ensuring the credibility of fiscal management. 4. The Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy will regularly review the progress in the conduct of macroeconomic policies including monetary policy, the current condition and future prospects of prices in the context of the price stability target under those policies, economic and fiscal situation including employment conditions, and progress in economic structural reform.   (Reference) Meeting hours: January 21: 14:00-16:52 January 22:  7:59-12:42 Policy Board members present:    Masaaki Shirakawa (Governor)    Hirohide Yamaguchi (Deputy Governor)    Kiyohiko G.

Under the price stability target specified above, the Bank will pursue monetary easing and aim to achieve this target at the earliest possible time.  Taking into consideration that it will take considerable time before the effects of monetary policy permeate the economy, the Bank will ascertain whether there is any significant risk to the sustainability of economic growth, including from the accumulation of financial imbalances. The Bank will pursue aggressive monetary easing, aiming to achieve the above-mentioned price stability target, through a virtually zero interest rate policy and purchases of financial assets, as long as the Bank judges it appropriate to continue with each policy measure respectively.1, 2  In addition, the Bank will provide support for financial institutions' efforts to strengthen the foundations for economic growth and to increase their lending.                                                    1 With regard to JGB purchases under the Asset Purchase Program, Ms. S.

20130404," 1 April 4, 2013 Bank of Japan  Introduction of the ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing""  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following. (1) The introduction of the ""quantitative and qualitative monetary easing"" The Bank will achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in terms of the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) at the earliest possible time, with a time horizon of about two years.[Note 1]a) The adoption of the ""monetary base control"" by a unanimous vote   In order to do so, it will enter a new phase of monetary easing both in terms of quantity and quality.  It will double the monetary base and the amounts outstanding of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) as well as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in two years, and more than double the average remaining maturity of JGB purchases. With a view to pursuing quantitative monetary easing, the main operating target for money market operations is changed from the uncollateralized overnight call rate to the monetary base.  Specifically, the guideline for money market operations is set as follows: The Bank of Japan will conduct money market operations so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 60-70 trillion yen.1b) An increase in JGB purchases and their maturity extension by a unanimous vote  With a view to encouraging a further decline in interest rates across the yield curve, the Bank will purchase JGBs so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 50 trillion yen.2In addition, JGBs with all maturities including 40-year bonds will be made eligible for purchase, and the average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be extended from slightly less than three years at present to about seven years -- equivalent                                                     1 Under this guideline, the monetary base -- whose amount outstanding was 138 trillion yen at end-2012 -- is expected to reach 200 trillion yen at end-2013 and 270 trillion yen at end-2014 (see Attachment). 2 The monthly flow of JGB purchases is expected to become 7+ trillion yen on a gross basis.  2 to the average maturity of the amount outstanding of JGBs issued.3, 4c) An increase in ETF and J-REIT purchases by a unanimous vote  With a view to lowering risk premia of asset prices, the Bank will purchase ETFs and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at an annual pace of 1 trillion yen and 30 billion yen respectively.5d) The continuation of the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing by an 8-1 majority vote  [Note 1] The Bank will continue with the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.  It will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices, and make adjustments as appropriate. [Note 2] (2) Actions accompanied by the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing a) The termination of the Asset Purchase Program The Asset Purchase Program will be terminated.  The purchases of JGBs conducted for facilitating money market operations -- including the amount outstanding of JGBs already purchased -- will be absorbed into the aforementioned JGB purchases. b) The temporary suspension of the ""banknote principle"" The aforementioned JGB purchases are executed for the purpose of conducting monetary policy and not for the purpose of financing fiscal deficits.  In addition, the government -- in the joint statement released with the Bank in January -- stated that ""in strengthening coordination between the Government and the Bank of Japan, the Government will steadily promote measures aimed at establishing a sustainable fiscal structure with a view to ensuring the credibility of fiscal management.""  Based on such recognition, the Bank will temporarily suspend the so-called banknote principle as it pursues the quantitative                                                    3 The average remaining maturity of JGBs purchased under the Asset Purchase Program and JGB purchases conducted for facilitating money market operations was slightly less than three years. 4 The average remaining maturity of JGBs to be purchased is subject to fluctuations, depending on bids by financial institutions; thus, it is appropriate to allow for its range of about six to eight years. 5 As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will continue with those asset purchases until their amounts outstanding reach 2.2 trillion yen and 3.2 trillion yen respectively; thereafter, it will maintain those amounts outstanding.  The upper limits (i.e., the single issuers' amounts outstanding) of CP, corporate bonds, ETFs, and J-REITs to be purchased by the Bank shall be the same as before.  3 and qualitative monetary easing.6c) Enhanced dialogue with market participants  In order to facilitate the aforementioned massive JGB purchases and significantly large-scale provision of the monetary base, the cooperation of market participants -- such as counterparties' active bidding in the Bank's market operations -- is vital.  The Bank will set forums for enhanced dialogue with those market participants in order to exchange views pertaining to money market operations and market transactions more generally.  In addition, the terms and conditions under the Securities Lending Facility (SLF) will be relaxed for the time being in order to ensure that the market liquidity of JGBs is maintained. (3) The extension of the funds-supplying operation to support financial institutions in disaster areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake The periods -- for which (i) the funds-supplying operation to support financial institutions in disaster areas and (ii) the amendment to temporary rules regarding the eligibility standards for debt of companies in disaster areas will remain effective -- will be extended by one year.  2. Japan's economy has stopped weakening and has shown some signs of picking up.  With regard to the outlook, it is expected to return to a moderate recovery path against the background of firm domestic demand and a pick-up in growth rates of overseas economies.  On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) has recently been slightly negative, but some indicators suggest a rise in inflation expectations.  In recent months, conditions in financial markets have turned favorable due to the abatement of global investors' risk aversion and expectations for domestic policies. The Bank of Japan -- in the joint statement released with the government in January -- has made a clear commitment to achieving the price stability target at the earliest possible time.  The quantitative and qualitative monetary easing, introduced by the Bank today, will underpin the Bank's commitment, and is expected not only to work through such transmission channels like longer-term interest rates and asset prices but also to drastically change the                                                    6 This principle indicates that the purchases of JGBs conducted for facilitating money market operations are subject to the limitation that the outstanding amount of long-term government bonds effectively held by the Bank be kept below the outstanding balance of banknotes issued.  It was decided at the Monetary Policy Meeting held on March 19, 2001.  4 expectations of markets and economic entities.  These effects will support the positive movements that have started to appear in economic activity and financial markets, contribute to a further pick-up in inflation expectations that appear to have risen, and lead Japan's economy to overcome deflation that has lasted for nearly 15 years.   [Note 1]  Mr. T. Kiuchi proposed (i) to delete ""with a time horizon of about two years,"" (ii) to add the following sentence, ""The Bank introduces the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing while setting the time frame of about two years as intensive periods for aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent,"" and (iii) to delete ""The continuation of the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing.""  The proposal was defeated by an 8-1 majority vote.  Voting for the proposal: Mr. T. Kiuchi.  Voting against the proposal: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Mr. R. Miyao, Mr. Y.

At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period:  The Bank of Japan will conduct money market operations so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 60-70 trillion yen. 2. With regard to the asset purchases, the Bank will continue with the following guidelines: a) The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 50 trillion yen, and that the average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be about seven years. b) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 1 trillion yen and about 30 billion yen respectively.  c) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will continue with those asset purchases until their amounts outstanding reach 2.2 trillion yen and 3.2 trillion yen respectively by end-2013; thereafter, it will maintain those amounts outstanding. 3. Japan's economy has started picking up.  Exports have stopped decreasing as overseas economies have been moving out of the deceleration phase that had continued since last year and are gradually heading toward a pick-up.  Business fixed investment continues to show resilience in nonmanufacturing and appears to have stopped weakening on the whole.  Public investment has continued to increase, and housing investment has generally been picking up.  Private consumption has seen increased resilience, assisted by the improvement in consumer sentiment.  Reflecting these developments in demand both at home and abroad, industrial production has stopped decreasing and signs of picking up have become increasingly evident.  Meanwhile, financial conditions are accommodative.  On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) has been negative, due to the reversal of the previous year's movements in  2 energy-related and durable consumer goods.  Some indicators suggest a rise in inflation expectations. 4. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is expected to return to a moderate recovery path, mainly against the background that domestic demand remains resilient due to the effects of monetary easing as well as various economic measures, and that growth rates of overseas economies gradually pick up.  The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is expected to register smaller declines for the time being, and thereafter is likely to gradually turn positive. 5. Regarding risks, there remains a high degree of uncertainty concerning Japan's economy, including the prospects for the European debt problem and the growth momentum of the U.S. economy as well as the emerging and commodity-exporting economies. 6. The Bank will continue with quantitative and qualitative monetary easing, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.  It will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices, and make adjustments as appropriate.[Note] Such conduct of monetary policy will support the positive movements in economic activity and financial markets, contribute to a rise in inflation expectations, and lead Japan's economy to overcome deflation that has lasted for nearly 15 years.                                                     [Note] Mr. T. Kiuchi proposed that the Bank will aim to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in the medium to long term and designate quantitative and qualitative monetary easing as an intensive measure with a time frame of about two years.

Figures in brackets indicate the median of the Policy Board members' forecasts (point estimates). 2. The forecasts of the majority of the Policy Board members are constructed as follows: each Policy Board member's forecast takes the form of a point estimate -- namely, the figure to which he or she attaches the highest probability of realization. These forecasts are then shown as a range, with the highest figure and the lowest figure excluded. The range does not indicate the forecast errors. 3. Individual Policy Board members make their forecasts assuming the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding future policy. 4. The scheduled consumption tax hikes for April 2014 and October 2015 -- to 8 percent and 10 percent, respectively -- are incorporated in the forecasts. In terms of the outlook for the CPI, individual Policy Board members make their forecasts based on figures excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hikes. 5. The forecasts for the CPI for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 that incorporate the direct effects of the consumption tax hikes are constructed as follows. First, the contribution to prices from each tax hike is mechanically computed on the assumption that the tax increase will be fully passed on for all taxable items.

20130808," 1 August 8, 2013 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period:  The Bank of Japan will conduct money market operations so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 60-70 trillion yen. 2. With regard to the asset purchases, the Bank will continue with the following guidelines: a) The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 50 trillion yen, and the average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be about seven years. b) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 1 trillion yen and about 30 billion yen respectively.  c) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will continue with those asset purchases until their amounts outstanding reach 2.2 trillion yen and 3.2 trillion yen respectively by end-2013; thereafter, it will maintain those amounts outstanding. 3. Japan's economy is starting to recover moderately.  Overseas economies as a whole are gradually heading toward a pick-up, although a lackluster performance is partly seen.  In this situation, exports have been picking up.  Business fixed investment has stopped weakening and shown some signs of picking up as corporate profits have improved.  Public investment has continued to increase, and the pick-up in housing investment has become evident.  Private consumption has remained resilient, assisted by the improvement in consumer sentiment.  Reflecting these developments in demand both at home and abroad, industrial production is increasing moderately.  Meanwhile, financial conditions are accommodative.  On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) has turned positive.  Inflation expectations appear to be rising on the whole.  2 4. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is expected to recover moderately on the back of the resilience in domestic demand and the pick-up in overseas economies.  The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to rise gradually. 5. Regarding risks, there remains a high degree of uncertainty concerning Japan's economy, including the prospects for the European debt problem, developments in the emerging and commodity-exporting economies, and the pace of recovery in the U.S. economy. 6. The Bank will continue with quantitative and qualitative monetary easing, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.  It will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices, and make adjustments as appropriate.[Note] Such conduct of monetary policy will support the positive movements in economic activity and financial markets, contribute to a rise in inflation expectations, and lead Japan's economy to overcome the deflation that has lasted for nearly 15 years.                                                     [Note] Mr. T. Kiuchi proposed that the Bank will aim to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in the medium to long term and designate quantitative and qualitative monetary easing as an intensive measure with a time frame of about two years.

Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately, and a front-loaded increase in demand prior to the consumption tax hike has recently been observed.  Overseas economies -- mainly advanced economies -- are starting to recover, although a lackluster performance is still seen in part.  In this situation, exports have generally been picking up.  Business fixed investment has been picking up as corporate profits have improved.  Public investment has continued to increase.  With improvement in the employment and income situation, housing investment has continued to increase and private consumption has remained resilient; in these segments of the economy, the front-loaded increase in demand prior to the consumption tax hike has also been observed.  Reflecting these developments in demand both at home and abroad, industrial production has been increasing moderately.  Meanwhile, financial conditions are accommodative.  On the price front, the year-on-year rate of increase in the  2 consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is around 1 percent.  Inflation expectations appear to be rising on the whole. 4. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is expected to continue a moderate recovery as a trend, while it will be affected by the front-loaded increase and subsequent decline in demand prior to and after the consumption tax hike.  The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI, excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hike, is likely to be around 1 percent for some time. 5. Compared with the forecasts presented in the October 2013 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices, the growth rate and year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI will likely be broadly in line with the October forecasts. 6. Risks to the outlook include developments in the emerging and commodity-exporting economies, the prospects for the European debt problem, and the pace of recovery in the U.S. economy.[Note 1] 7. The Bank will continue with quantitative and qualitative monetary easing, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.  It will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices, and make adjustments as appropriate.[Note 2] Such conduct of monetary policy will support the positive movements in economic activity and financial markets, contribute to a rise in inflation expectations, and lead Japan's economy to overcome the deflation that has lasted for nearly 15 years.                                                     [Note 1] Ms. S. Shirai dissented from the description in paragraph 6, suggesting that the pace of improvement in the employment and income situation in Japan should be added. [Note 2] Mr. T. Kiuchi proposed that the Bank will aim to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in the medium to long term and designate quantitative and qualitative monetary easing as an intensive measure with a time frame of about two years.  The proposal was defeated by an 8-1 majority vote.  Voting for the proposal: Mr. T. Kiuchi.  Voting against the proposal: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Mr. R. Miyao, Mr. Y. Morimoto, Ms. S. Shirai, Mr. K. Ishida, and Mr. T. Sato.  3 (Appendix 1) Forecasts of the Majority of Policy Board Members y/y % chg.

Figures in brackets indicate the median of the Policy Board members' forecasts (point estimates). 2. The forecasts of the majority of the Policy Board members are constructed as follows: each Policy Board member's forecast takes the form of a point estimate -- namely, the figure to which he or she attaches the highest probability of realization. These forecasts are then shown as a range, with the highest figure and the lowest figure excluded. The range does not indicate the forecast errors. 3. Individual Policy Board members make their forecasts assuming the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding future policy. 4. The scheduled consumption tax hikes for April 2014 and October 2015 -- to 8 percent and 10 percent, respectively -- are incorporated in the forecasts. In terms of the outlook for the CPI, individual Policy Board members make their forecasts based on figures excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hikes. 5. The forecasts for the CPI for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 that incorporate the direct effects of the consumption tax hikes are constructed as follows. First, the contribution to prices from each tax hike is mechanically computed on the assumption that the tax increase will be fully passed on for all taxable items. The CPI for fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015 will be pushed up by 2.0 percentage points and 0.7 percentage point, respectively. Second, these figures are added to the forecasts made by the Policy Board members. 6. The ranges shown below include the forecasts of all Policy Board members. y/y % chg.

The Policy Board also decided, by a unanimous vote, to double the scale of (i) the Fund-Provisioning Measure to Stimulate Bank Lending (hereafter ""Stimulating Bank Lending Facility"") and (ii) the Fund-Provisioning Measure to Support Strengthening the Foundations for Economic Growth (hereafter ""Growth-Supporting Funding Facility""), and to extend the application period for these facilities by one year.1  Before today's decision, these were due to expire shortly. Specifically, under the Stimulating Bank Lending Facility, financial institutions will be able to borrow funds from the Bank up to an amount that is twice as much as the net increase in their lending.  As for the Growth-Supporting Funding Facility, the maximum amount of the Bank's fund-provisioning under the main rules will be doubled from 3.5 trillion yen to 7                                                    1 See Attachment for details.  2 trillion yen.  Under these facilities, financial institutions will be able to borrow funds at a fixed rate of 0.1 percent per annum for 4 years instead of 1-3 years at present. The Bank expects that these enhancements will further promote financial institutions' actions as well as stimulate firms' and households' demand for credit, with a view to encouraging banks' lending and strengthening the foundations for economic growth. 4. Furthermore, the Policy Board decided, by a unanimous vote, to extend the Funds-Supplying Operation to Support Financial Institutions in Disaster Areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Temporary Rules regarding the Eligibility Standards for Debt of Companies in Disaster Areas by one year. 5. Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately, and a front-loaded increase in demand prior to the consumption tax hike has recently been observed.  Overseas economies -- mainly advanced economies -- are starting to recover, although a lackluster performance is still seen in part.  In this situation, exports have generally been picking up.

The deadline for new applications under the facility shall be extended by one year.[Note 2]   B. The maximum amount of the Bank's fund-provisioning to each financial institution shall be an amount that is twice as much as the net increase in its lending.[Note 3]   C. The interest rate applied to the facility shall be fixed at 0.1 percent per annum for four years.  Financial institutions have an option to make prepayment every year.  2.  Growth-Supporting Funding Facility A. The deadline for new applications under the main rules as well as special rules for equity investments and asset-based lending, small-lot investments and loans, and the U.S. dollar lending arrangement shall be extended by one year.[Note 4]   B. The maximum amount of the Bank's fund-provisioning under the main rules shall be doubled from 3.5 trillion yen to 7 trillion yen.  The maximum amount of its fund-provisioning to each financial institution shall be increased from 150 billion yen to 1 trillion yen.                                                    [Note 1] Amendments to relevant principal terms and conditions will be decided at the next Monetary Policy Meeting. [Note 2] The disbursement under the current framework shall end in March 2014.  The disbursement after June 2014 shall be based on the new framework (1.B. and C. mentioned above).  Unused amount under the current framework cannot be carried over to the new framework.  Under the new framework, unused amount at the time of disbursement cannot be carried over to subsequent disbursements. [Note 3] Based on the assumption that the growth rate of bank lending and the utilization rate of this facility remain more or less at current levels, the amount outstanding of fund-provisioning under this facility is estimated to be around 30 trillion yen. [Note 4] The disbursement under the new framework (2.B. and C. mentioned above) will begin in June 2014.  5   C. The interest rate applied to the facility under the main rules and special rules for equity investments and asset-based lending, and small-lot investments and loans shall be fixed at 0.1 percent per annum for four years.  Financial institutions have an option to make prepayment every year.   (Reference) Meeting hours: February 17: 14:00-16:11 February 18:  9:00-12:23 Policy Board members present:    Haruhiko Kuroda (Governor)    Kikuo Iwata (Deputy Governor)    Hiroshi Nakaso (Deputy Governor)    Ryuzo Miyao Yoshihisa Morimoto Sayuri Shirai Koji Ishida Takehiro Sato Takahide Kiuchi   (Others present) February 17 From the Ministry of Finance: Masatsugu Asakawa, Deputy Vice Minister for Policy Planning and Co-ordination (14:00-16:11) From the Cabinet Office: Kenji Umetani, Vice-Minister for Policy Coordination (14:00-16:11)  February 18 From the Ministry of Finance: Yoshihisa Furukawa, Senior Vice Minister of Finance (9:00-12:06,12:18-12:23) From the Cabinet Office:  Yasutoshi Nishimura, Senior Vice-Minister of Cabinet Office  (9:00-12:06,12:18-12:23) Release of the Monthly Report of Recent Economic and Financial Developments: 14:00 on Wednesday, February 19 (Japanese) 16:30 on Thursday, February 20 (English)  -- The English translation of the summary of the Monthly Report will be released at 14:00 on Wednesday, February 19 Release of the minutes: 8:50 on Friday, March 14 "

20140521," 1 May 21, 2014 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period:  The Bank of Japan will conduct money market operations so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 60-70 trillion yen. 2. With regard to the asset purchases, the Bank will continue with the following guidelines: a) The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 50 trillion yen, and the average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be about seven years. b) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 1 trillion yen and about 30 billion yen respectively.  c) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen respectively. 3. Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately as a trend, although the subsequent decline in demand following the front-loaded increase prior to the consumption tax hike has been observed.  Overseas economies -- mainly advanced economies -- are starting to recover, although a lackluster performance is still seen in part.  Exports have recently leveled off more or less.  Business fixed investment has increased moderately as corporate profits have improved.  Public investment has more or less leveled off at a high level.  Private consumption and housing investment have remained resilient as a trend with improvement in the employment and income situation, although the subsequent decline in demand following the front-loaded increase has recently been observed.  Reflecting these developments in demand both at home and abroad, industrial production has been on a moderate increasing trend.  Meanwhile, financial conditions are accommodative.  On the price front, the  2 year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is around 1 percent.  Inflation expectations appear to be rising on the whole. 4. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is expected to continue a moderate recovery as a trend, while it will be affected by the subsequent decline in demand following the front-loaded increase prior to the consumption tax hike.  The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI, excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hike, is likely to be around 1 percent for some time. 5. Risks to the outlook include developments in the emerging and commodity-exporting economies, the prospects for the European debt problem, and the pace of recovery in the U.S. economy. 6. Quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) has been exerting its intended effects, and the Bank will continue with the QQE, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.  It will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices, and make adjustments as appropriate.[Note]                                                      [Note] Mr. T. Kiuchi proposed that the Bank will aim to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in the medium to long term and designate the QQE as an intensive measure with a time frame of about two years.  The proposal was defeated by an 8-1 majority vote.  Voting for the proposal: Mr. T. Kiuchi.  Voting against the proposal: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Mr. R. Miyao,          Mr. Y.

Figures in brackets indicate the median of the Policy Board members' forecasts (point estimates). 2. The forecasts of the majority of the Policy Board members are constructed as follows: each Policy Board member's forecast takes the form of a point estimate -- namely, the figure to which he or she attaches the highest probability of realization. These forecasts are then shown as a range, with the highest figure and the lowest figure excluded. The range does not indicate the forecast errors. 3. Individual Policy Board members make their forecasts assuming the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding future policy. 4. The consumption tax hike in April 2014 -- to 8 percent -- and the one scheduled for October 2015 -- to 10 percent -- are incorporated in the forecasts. In terms of the outlook for the CPI, individual Policy Board members make their forecasts based on figures excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hikes. 5. The forecasts for the CPI that incorporate the direct effects of the consumption tax hikes are constructed as follows. First, the contribution to prices from each tax hike is mechanically computed on the assumption that the tax increase will be fully passed on for all taxable items. The CPI will be pushed up by 2.0 percentage points for fiscal 2014 and by 0.7 percentage point for fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016, respectively. Second, these figures are added to the forecasts made by the Policy Board members.  6. The ranges shown below include the forecasts of all Policy Board members. y/y % chg.

First, upper and lower    10 percentiles of the aggregated distributions are trimmed and second, colors indicated below are used to show    the respective percentiles of those distributions.2. For the process of compilation of the Risk Balance Charts, see the box on page 9 of the April 2008 Outlook    for Economic Activity and Prices.3.

20141007," 1 October 7, 2014 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period:  The Bank of Japan will conduct money market operations so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 60-70 trillion yen. 2. With regard to the asset purchases, the Bank will continue with the following guidelines: a) The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 50 trillion yen, and the average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be about seven years. b) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 1 trillion yen and about 30 billion yen respectively.  c) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen respectively. 3. Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately as a trend, although some weakness particularly on the production side has been observed due mainly to the effects of the subsequent decline in demand following the front-loaded increase prior to the consumption tax hike.  Overseas economies -- mainly advanced economies -- have been recovering, albeit with a lackluster performance still seen in part.  Exports have shown some weakness.  Business fixed investment has increased moderately as corporate profits have improved.  Public investment has more or less leveled off at a high level.  Private consumption has remained resilient as a trend with the employment and income situation improving steadily, and the effects of the decline in demand following the front-loaded increase have been waning on the whole, albeit unevenly.  As for housing investment, the decline following the front-loaded increase has continued.  Industrial production has recently been showing some weakness, due in part to inventory adjustments.  Business sentiment has generally stayed at  2 a favorable level, although its improvement has paused due mainly to the effects of the consumption tax hike.  Meanwhile, financial conditions are accommodative.  On the price front, the year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food), excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hike, is around 1 percent.  Inflation expectations appear to be rising on the whole.[Note 1] 4. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is expected to continue its moderate recovery trend, and the effects including those of the subsequent decline in demand following the front-loaded increase prior to the consumption tax hike are expected to wane gradually.  The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be around 1 percent for some time. 5. Risks to the outlook include developments in the emerging and commodity-exporting economies, the prospects for the European debt problem, and the pace of recovery in the U.S. economy. 6. Quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) has been exerting its intended effects, and the Bank will continue with the QQE, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.  It will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices, and make adjustments as appropriate.[Note 2]                                                      [Note 1] Ms. S. Shirai dissented from the description on inflation expectations, and suggested changing it to a new expression that inflation expectations have been on an uptrend from a somewhat longer-term perspective, although an increasing number of indicators have recently been more or less flat. [Note 2] Mr. T. Kiuchi proposed that the Bank will aim to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in the medium to long term and designate the QQE as an intensive measure with a time frame of about two years.  The proposal was defeated by an 8-1 majority vote.  Voting for the proposal: Mr. T. Kiuchi.  Voting against the proposal: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Mr. R. Miyao,          Mr. Y.

20141031," 1 October 31, 2014 Bank of Japan  Expansion of the Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following measures. (1) Accelerating the pace of increase in the monetary base by a 5-4 majority vote [Note 1] The Bank will conduct money market operations so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen (an addition of about 10-20 trillion yen compared with the past). (2) Increasing asset purchases and extending the average remaining maturity of Japanese government bond (JGB) purchases by a 5-4 majority vote [Note 2] a) The Bank will purchase JGBs so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen (an addition of about 30 trillion yen compared with the past).  With a view to encouraging a decline in interest rates across the entire yield curve, the Bank will conduct purchases in a flexible manner in accordance with financial market conditions.  The average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be extended to about 7-10 years (an extension of about 3 years at maximum compared with the past). b) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 3 trillion yen (tripled compared with the past) and about 90 billion yen (tripled compared with the past), respectively.  The Bank will make ETFs that track the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 eligible for purchase.1 2. Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately as a trend and is expected to continue growing at a pace above its potential.  However, on the price front, somewhat weak developments in demand following the consumption tax hike and a substantial decline in crude oil prices have been exerting downward pressure recently.  A temporary weakness in                                                    1 As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen, respectively (as in the past).  2 demand has already started to wane, and the decline in crude oil prices will have positive effects on economic activity from a somewhat longer-term perspective and will push up prices.  Nevertheless, if the current downward pressure on prices remains, albeit in the short term, there is a risk that conversion of deflationary mindset, which has so far been progressing steadily, might be delayed.  To pre-empt manifestation of such risk and to maintain the improving momentum of expectation formation, the Bank judged it appropriate to expand the quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE).   3. The Bank will continue with the QQE, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.  It will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices, and make adjustments as appropriate.2 [Note 3]   [Note 1] Voting for the action: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H.

With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is expected to continue its moderate recovery trend, and the effects such as those of the decline in demand following the front-loaded increase prior to the consumption tax hike are expected to dissipate.  The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to slow for the time being, reflecting the decline in energy prices.  3 6. Compared with the forecasts presented in the October 2014 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices, the growth rate will likely be lower for fiscal 2014, but will likely be higher for fiscal 2015 and 2016.  With regard to the CPI, the outlook for the underlying trend remains unchanged, but the year-on-year rate of increase will likely be lower toward fiscal 2015, due to the significant decline in crude oil prices.  The rate of increase for fiscal 2016 will likely be more or less unchanged from the October forecast.2 7. Risks to the outlook include developments in the emerging and commodity-exporting economies, the prospects regarding the debt problem and the risk of low inflation rates being protracted in Europe, and the pace of recovery in the U.S. economy. 8. Quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) has been exerting its intended effects, and the Bank will continue with the QQE, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.  It will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices, and make adjustments as appropriate.[Note 3]                                                      [Note 1] Voting for the action: Mr. H.

Dubai crude oil prices are expected to rise moderately from the recent 55 U.S. dollars per barrel to about 70 dollars per barrel toward the end of the projection period.  In this case, the contribution of energy items to the CPI (all items less fresh food) is estimated to be mostly in the range of minus 0.7 to minus 0.8 percentage point for fiscal 2015, and mostly in the range of plus 0.1 to plus 0.2 percentage point for fiscal 2016.  4 (Appendix 1) Forecasts of the Majority of Policy Board Members y/y % chg.

Figures in brackets indicate the median of the Policy Board members' forecasts (point estimates). 2. The forecasts of the majority of the Policy Board members are constructed as follows: each Policy Board member's forecast takes the form of a point estimate -- namely, the figure to which he or she attaches the highest probability of realization. These forecasts are then shown as a range, with the highest figure and the lowest figure excluded. The range does not indicate the forecast errors. 3. Individual Policy Board members make their forecasts assuming the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding future policy. 4. Dubai crude oil prices are expected to rise moderately from the recent 55 U.S. dollars per barrel to about 70 dollars per barrel toward the end of the projection period.  In this case, the contribution of energy items to the CPI (all items less fresh food) is estimated to be mostly in the range of minus 0.7 to minus 0.8 percentage point for fiscal 2015, and mostly in the range of plus 0.1 to plus 0.2 percentage point for fiscal 2016. 5. The consumption tax hike in April 2014 -- to 8 percent -- and the one scheduled for April 2017 -- to 10 percent -- are incorporated in the forecasts. In terms of the outlook for the CPI, individual Policy Board members make their forecasts based on figures excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hikes. 6. The forecasts for the CPI that incorporate the direct effects of the consumption tax hikes are constructed as follows. First, the contribution to prices from each tax hike is mechanically computed on the assumption that the tax increase will be fully passed on for all taxable items. The CPI will be pushed up by 2.0 percentage points for fiscal 2014. Second, this figure is added to the forecasts made by the Policy Board members.  The forecasts as of October 2014 assumed that the consumption tax -- after having risen to 8 percent in April 2014 -- would rise to 10 percent in October 2015. The contribution to prices from each tax hike was 2.0 percentage points for fiscal 2014 and 0.7 percentage point for both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016. These figures were added to the forecasts made by the Policy Board members. 7. The ranges shown below include the forecasts of all Policy Board members. y/y % chg.

20150218," 1 February 18, 2015 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period:[Note 1]  The Bank of Japan will conduct money market operations so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen. 2. With regard to the asset purchases, the Bank decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to continue with the following guidelines:[Note 2] a) The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen.  With a view to encouraging a decline in interest rates across the entire yield curve, the Bank will conduct purchases in a flexible manner in accordance with financial market conditions.  The average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be about 7-10 years. b) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 3 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen respectively.  c) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen respectively. 3. Japan's economy has continued its moderate recovery trend.  Overseas economies -- mainly advanced economies -- have been recovering, albeit with a lackluster performance still seen in part.  In this situation, exports have been picking up.  Business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend as corporate profits have improved.  Public investment has more or less leveled off at a high level.  Private consumption as a whole has remained resilient against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation, although recovery in some areas has been sluggish.  Housing investment, which continued to decline following the front-loaded increase prior to the consumption tax hike, has recently started to bottom out.  Against the backdrop of these developments in demand  2 both at home and abroad, industrial production has been picking up, due in part to the progress in inventory adjustments.  Meanwhile, financial conditions are accommodative.  On the price front, the year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food), excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hike, is around 0.5 percent.  Inflation expectations appear to be rising on the whole from a somewhat longer-term perspective. 4. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is expected to continue its moderate recovery trend.

The average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be about 7-10 years. b) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 3 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen respectively.  c) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen respectively.

Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately.  Overseas economies -- mainly advanced economies -- have been recovering, albeit with a lackluster performance still seen in part.  In this situation, exports have been picking up.  Business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend as corporate profits have improved.  Public investment has entered a moderate declining trend, although at a high level.  Private consumption has been resilient against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation.  Housing investment has bottomed out and shown some signs of picking up.  Reflecting these developments in demand both at home and abroad, industrial production has been picking up.  Meanwhile, financial conditions are accommodative.  On the price front,  2 the year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food), excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hike, is about 0 percent.  Inflation expectations appear to be rising on the whole from a somewhat longer-term perspective. 4. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is expected to continue recovering moderately.  The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be about 0 percent for the time being, due to the effects of the decline in energy prices. 5. Risks to the outlook include developments in the emerging and commodity-exporting economies, the prospects regarding the debt problem and the momentum of economic activity and prices in Europe, and the pace of recovery in the U.S. economy. 6. Quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) has been exerting its intended effects, and the Bank will continue with QQE, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.  It will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices, and make adjustments as appropriate.[Note 2]                                                      [Note 1] Voting for the action: Mr. H.

Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately.  Overseas economies -- mainly advanced economies -- have been recovering, albeit with a lackluster performance still seen in part.  In this situation, exports and industrial production have been picking up, albeit with some fluctuations.  As corporate profits have improved and business sentiment has generally stayed at a favorable level, business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend.  Against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation, private consumption has been resilient and housing investment has started to pick up.  Meanwhile, public investment has entered a moderate declining trend, although it remains at a high level.  Financial conditions are accommodative.  On the price front, the year-on-year  2 rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is about 0 percent.  Inflation expectations appear to be rising on the whole from a somewhat longer-term perspective. 4. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is expected to continue recovering moderately.  The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be about 0 percent for the time being, due to the effects of the decline in energy prices. 5. Compared with the forecasts presented in the April 2015 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices, the growth rate will likely be somewhat lower for fiscal 2015, but will likely be more or less unchanged for fiscal 2016 and 2017.  The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI will likely be broadly in line with the April forecast.1 6. Risks to the outlook include developments in the emerging and commodity-exporting economies, the prospects regarding the debt problem and the momentum of economic activity and prices in Europe, and the pace of recovery in the U.S. economy. 7. Quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) has been exerting its intended effects, and the Bank will continue with QQE, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.  It will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices, and make adjustments as appropriate.[Note 2]                                                        1 Individual Policy Board members make their forecasts based on the following assumption about crude oil prices.  Dubai crude oil prices are expected to rise moderately from the recent 60 U.S. dollars per barrel to about 70 dollars per barrel toward the end of the projection period.  Under this assumption, the contribution of energy items to the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is estimated to be mostly in the range of minus 0.7 to minus 0.8 percentage point for fiscal 2015, and mostly in the range of plus 0.1 to plus 0.2 percentage point for fiscal 2016.  More specifically, this contribution is expected to fall further into negative territory for the time being, followed by a narrowing in the negative contribution in the second half of fiscal 2015; in the first half of fiscal 2016, the contribution is estimated to be around 0 percentage point.  3                                                    [Note 1] Voting for the action: Mr. H.

Figures in brackets indicate the median of the Policy Board members' forecasts (point estimates). 2. The forecasts of the majority of the Policy Board members are constructed as follows: each Policy Board member's forecast takes the form of a point estimate -- namely, the figure to which he or she attaches the highest probability of realization. These forecasts are then shown as a range, with the highest figure and the lowest figure excluded. The range does not indicate the forecast errors. 3. Individual Policy Board members make their forecasts assuming the effects of past policy decisions and with reference to views incorporated in financial markets regarding future policy. 4. Dubai crude oil prices are expected to rise moderately from the recent 60 U.S. dollars per barrel to about 70 dollars per barrel toward the end of the projection period. Under this assumption, the contribution of energy items to the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is estimated to be mostly in the range of minus 0.7 to minus 0.8 percentage point for fiscal 2015, and mostly in the range of plus 0.1 to plus 0.2 percentage point for fiscal 2016. More specifically, this contribution is expected to fall further into negative territory for the time being, followed by a narrowing in the negative contribution in the second half of fiscal 2015; in the first half of fiscal 2016, the contribution is estimated to be around 0 percentage point. 5. The consumption tax hike scheduled to take place in April 2017 -- to 10 percent -- is incorporated in the forecasts, but individual Policy Board members make their forecasts of the CPI based on figures excluding the direct effects of the consumption tax hike. The forecasts for the CPI for fiscal 2017 that incorporate the direct effects of the consumption tax hike are constructed as follows. First, the contribution to prices from each tax hike is mechanically computed on the assumption that the tax increase will be fully passed on for all taxable items. The CPI will be pushed up by 1.3 percentage points. Second, this figure is added to the forecasts made by the Policy Board members. 6.

20150807," 1 August 7, 2015 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period:[Note 1]  The Bank of Japan will conduct money market operations so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen. 2. With regard to the asset purchases, the Bank decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to continue with the following guidelines:[Note 1] a) The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen.  With a view to encouraging a decline in interest rates across the entire yield curve, the Bank will conduct purchases in a flexible manner in accordance with financial market conditions.  The average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be about 7-10 years. b) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 3 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen respectively.  c) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen respectively. 3. Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately.  Overseas economies -- mainly advanced economies -- have been recovering, albeit with a lackluster performance still seen in part.  In this situation, exports and industrial production have been picking up, albeit with some fluctuations.  Business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend as corporate profits have improved.  Against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation, private consumption has been resilient and housing investment has been picking up.  Meanwhile, public investment has entered a moderate declining trend, although it remains at a high level.  Financial conditions are accommodative.  On the price front, the year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI, all  2 items less fresh food) is about 0 percent.  Inflation expectations appear to be rising on the whole from a somewhat longer-term perspective. 4. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is expected to continue recovering moderately.  The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be about 0 percent for the time being, due to the effects of the decline in energy prices. 5. Risks to the outlook include developments in the emerging and commodity-exporting economies, the prospects regarding the debt problem and the momentum of economic activity and prices in Europe, and the pace of recovery in the U.S. economy. 6. Quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) has been exerting its intended effects, and the Bank will continue with QQE, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.  It will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices, and make adjustments as appropriate.[Note 2]                                                      [Note 1] Voting for the action: Mr. H.

20150915," 1 September 15, 2015 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period:[Note 1]  The Bank of Japan will conduct money market operations so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen. 2. With regard to the asset purchases, the Bank decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to continue with the following guidelines:[Note 1] a) The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen.  With a view to encouraging a decline in interest rates across the entire yield curve, the Bank will conduct purchases in a flexible manner in accordance with financial market conditions.  The average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be about 7-10 years. b) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 3 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen respectively.  c) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen respectively. 3. Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately, although exports and production are affected by the slowdown in emerging economies.  Overseas economies -- mainly advanced economies -- have continued to grow at a moderate pace, despite the slowdown in emerging economies.  Exports and industrial production have recently been more or less flat, due mainly to the effects of the slowdown in emerging economies.  On the domestic demand side, business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend as corporate profits have continued to improve markedly.  Against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation, private consumption has been resilient and housing investment has been picking up.  Meanwhile, public investment has entered a moderate  2 declining trend, although it remains at a high level.  Financial conditions are accommodative.  On the price front, the year-on-year rate of increase in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is about 0 percent.  Inflation expectations appear to be rising on the whole from a somewhat longer-term perspective. 4. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is expected to continue recovering moderately.  The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI is likely to be about 0 percent for the time being, due to the effects of the decline in energy prices. 5. Risks to the outlook include developments in the emerging and commodity-exporting economies, the prospects regarding the debt problem and the momentum of economic activity and prices in Europe, and the pace of recovery in the U.S. economy. 6. Quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) has been exerting its intended effects, and the Bank will continue with QQE, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.  It will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices, and make adjustments as appropriate.[Note 2]                                                      [Note 1] Voting for the action: Mr. H.

Kiuchi proposed that the Bank will conduct money market operations and asset purchases so that the monetary base and the amount outstanding of its JGB holdings will increase at an annual pace of about 45 trillion yen, respectively.  The proposal was defeated by a majority vote.  [Note 2] Mr. T. Kiuchi proposed that the Bank will, with the aim to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in the medium to long term, continue with asset purchases and a virtually zero interest rate policy as long as each of these policy measures is deemed appropriate under flexible policy conduct based on the examination from the two perspectives of the monetary policy framework.

With regard to the asset purchases, the Bank decided, by a 6-3 majority vote, to set the following guidelines:[Note 2] a) The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen.  With a view to encouraging a decline in interest rates across the entire yield curve, the Bank will conduct purchases in a flexible manner in accordance with financial market conditions.  The average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be about 7-10 years until the end of this year and be extended to about 7-12 years from the beginning of next year. b) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 3 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen respectively.  c) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen respectively. 3. Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately, although exports and production have been affected by the slowdown in emerging economies.  Overseas economies -- mainly advanced economies -- have continued to grow at a moderate pace, despite the slowdown in emerging economies.  In this situation, exports have been picking up, although sluggishness remains in some areas.  On the domestic demand side, business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend as corporate profits have continued to improve markedly.  Against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation, private consumption has been resilient and housing investment has been picking up.  Public  2 investment has been on a moderate declining trend, although it remains at a high level.  Industrial production has continued to be more or less flat.  Meanwhile, business sentiment has generally stayed at a favorable level, although somewhat cautious developments have been observed in some areas.  Financial conditions are accommodative.  On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is about 0 percent.  Inflation expectations appear to be rising on the whole from a somewhat longer-term perspective, although some indicators have recently shown relatively weak developments. 4. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is expected to continue recovering moderately.  The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to be about 0 percent for the time being, due to the effects of the decline in energy prices. 5. Risks to the outlook include developments in the emerging and commodity-exporting economies, the prospects regarding the debt problem and the momentum of economic activity and prices in Europe, and the pace of recovery in the U.S. economy. 6. Quantitative and qualitative monetary easing (QQE) has been exerting its intended effects, and the Bank will continue with QQE, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.  It will examine both upside and downside risks to economic activity and prices, and make adjustments as appropriate.[Note 3] 7. In pursuing QQE according to the policy mentioned above, it is appropriate to encourage a smoother decline in interest rates across the entire yield curve taking into account developments in the JGB market and the situation in financial institutions' asset holdings.  Moreover, as conversion of firms' and households' deflationary mindset has been progressing under QQE and many firms have become proactive in making investment in physical and human capital, it is desirable that these developments will become further widespread.  From this perspective, the Bank decided to adopt supplementary measures for QQE (see Attachment for details).    3                                                    [Note 1] Voting for the action: Mr. H.

Measures to support firms' investment in physical and human capital A.  Establishing a new program for purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by a 6-3 majority vote[Note 1] The Bank will establish a new program for purchasing ETFs at an annual pace of about 300 billion yen, in addition to the current program of ETF purchases under which their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 3 trillion yen.1  Under this new program, the Bank will purchase ETFs composed of stocks issued by firms that are proactively making investment in physical and human capital.  The new program will start with purchases of ETFs which track the JPX-Nikkei Index 400.  The Bank will start purchasing ETFs that are consistent with the objective of this measure when such ETFs are newly launched.  The Bank will commence purchasing ETFs under the new program from April 2016 with a view to offsetting possible market impact stemming from the scheduled sales of stocks that the Bank had purchased from banks for financial stability purpose.2 B.  Enhancing the Fund-Provisioning Measure to Support Strengthening the Foundations for Economic Growth by a unanimous vote The Bank will add a new category (""Firms that are proactively making investment in physical and human capital"") to the current list of 18 possible areas to which financial                                                    1 Currently, the Bank purchases ETFs that track one of the following three stock indices; the Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), the Nikkei 225 Stock Average, or the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 (JPX-Nikkei 400).  The amount of each issue of ETF purchased by the Bank has been proportionate to the total market value of that issue. 2 The Bank had purchased stocks held by financial institutions since November 2002 in order to enhance their efforts to reduce shareholdings.  The Bank started selling these purchased stocks in the market in October 2007 for a while.  The Bank has suspended its selling of the purchased stocks, by taking account of developments in financial markets at home and abroad, which is to be resumed from April 2016.  With regard to the selling of the purchased stocks, the Policy Board decided at a regular meeting held yesterday to extend the length of time for selling stocks to ten years from previously planned five and a half years.  The amount to be sold is projected to be about 300 billion yen annually based on the mark-to-market value at the end of November 2015.  5 institutions' investment or lending are recognized as eligible for the Bank's Fund-Provisioning Measure to Support Strengthening the Foundations for Economic Growth.  At the same time, the Bank will simplify procedures for eligibility assessment of financial institutions' investment or lending to the firms relevant to this category -- for example, investment or lending to firms receiving preferential treatments by the tax code can be applied for the Bank's simplified procedures.3 C.  Extending the application periods for the Loan Support Program and other measures by a unanimous vote The Bank will extend by one year the deadlines for new applications for the Fund-Provisioning Measure to Stimulate Bank Lending, the Fund-Provisioning Measure to Support Strengthening the Foundations for Economic Growth, the Funds-Supplying Operation to Support Financial Institutions in Disaster Areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake, and the Temporary Rules regarding the Eligibility Standards for Debt of Companies in Disaster Areas.  2.  Measures to facilitate smooth implementation of Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) A.  Expanding eligible collateral for the Bank's provision of credit by a unanimous vote Financial institutions' holdings of eligible collateral have decreased as JGB purchases by the Bank have progressed under QQE.  In light of this situation, the Bank decided to (1) accept foreign currency-denominated loans on deeds as eligible collateral and to (2) introduce a framework in which the Bank will accept financial institutions' housing loans portfolio as collateral through a trust scheme.3 B.  Extending the average remaining maturity of JGB purchases by a 6-3 majority vote[Note 2] Considering that the gross amount of the Bank's JGB purchases is expected to increase,4 the Bank will extend the average remaining maturity of its JGB purchases from about 7-10                                                    3 Amendments to relevant principal terms and conditions will be decided at a future Monetary Policy Meeting.  Thereafter, these measures will be implemented soon after necessary preparations are completed. 4 Under the current guideline for asset purchases, the gross amount of the Bank's JGB purchases in 2016 is expected to increase to about 120 trillion yen from about 110 trillion yen in 2015, due to an increase in the redemption of government bonds held by the Bank at maturity.  6 years to about 7-12 years, in order to facilitate flexible and smooth purchase of JGBs.  Moreover, in order to secure market liquidity of JGBs, the Bank will allow continuous use of its Securities Lending Facility for a longer period.5  These measures will be put into effect in January 2016. C.  Increasing the maximum amount of each issue of Japan real estate investment trust (J-REIT) to be purchased by a 6-3 majority vote[Note 3] Since the amount outstanding of the Bank's holdings has been increasing in comparison with the total market value, the maximum amount of each issue of J-REIT to be purchased shall be increased from the current 5 percent to 10 percent of the total amount of that J-REIT issued.3                                                     [Note 1] Voting for the action: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Ms. S. Shirai, Mr. Y. Harada, and Mr. Y. Funo.  Voting against the action: Mr. K. Ishida, Mr. T. Sato, and Mr. T. Kiuchi.          The members voting against the action gave the following reasons: Mr. K. Ishida and Mr. T. Sato considered that newly proposed ETF purchases should be conducted within the current program so that an annual pace of increase in the Bank's ETF holdings will continue to be about 3 trillion yen; and Mr. T. Kiuchi considered it as inconsistent with his proposal, which includes a reduction in the amount of ETF purchases.  [Note 2] Voting for the proposal: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Ms. S. Shirai, Mr. Y. Harada, and Mr. Y. Funo.  Voting against the proposal: Mr. K. Ishida, Mr. T. Sato, and Mr. T. Kiuchi.  The members voting against the proposal gave the following reasons: Mr. K. Ishida and Mr. T. Sato considered that the Bank can manage its JGB purchases under the current average remaining maturity of about 7-10 years; and Mr. T. Kiuchi considered it as inconsistent with his proposal, which includes making the average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases about seven years. [Note 3] Voting for the proposal: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Ms. S. Shirai, Mr. Y. Harada, and Mr. Y. Funo.  Voting against the proposal: Mr. K. Ishida, Mr. T. Sato, and Mr. T. Kiuchi.  The members voting against the proposal gave the following reasons: Mr. K. Ishida expressed a concern over an increase in the maximum amount of each issue of J-REIT to be purchased, which could be an inappropriate signal to the real estate market; Mr. T. Sato considered that the Bank should maintain the current maximum amount of each issue of J-REIT to be purchased; and Mr. T. Kiuchi considered that such an increase is unnecessary for his proposal, which includes a reduction in the amount of J-REIT purchases.                                                    5 The Bank will increase the number of business days permitted for continuous use of this facility per issue of JGBs from the current 15 business days to 50 business days. (Reference) Meeting hours: December 17 : 14:00-15:51 December 18 :  9:00-12:45 Policy Board members present:    Haruhiko Kuroda (Governor)    Kikuo Iwata (Deputy Governor)    Hiroshi Nakaso (Deputy Governor) Sayuri Shirai Koji Ishida Takehiro Sato Takahide Kiuchi Yutaka Harada Yukitoshi Funo (Others present) December 17 From the Ministry of Finance: Mitsuru Ota, Deputy Vice Minister for Policy Planning and Co-ordination (14:00-15:51) From the Cabinet Office: Masao Nishikawa, Vice-Minister for Policy Coordination (14:00-15:51)  December 18 From the Ministry of Finance: Naoki Okada, State Minister of Finance (9:00-12:17, 12:36-12:45) From the Cabinet Office:  Shuichi Takatori, State Minister of Cabinet Office (9:00-12:17, 12:36-12:45) Release of the Monthly Report of Recent Economic and Financial Developments: 14:00 on Monday, December 21 (Japanese) 16:30 on Tuesday, December 22 (English)  -- The English translation of the summary of the Monthly Report will be released at 14:00 on Monday, December 21 Release of the Summary of Opinions: 8:50 on Friday, January 8 Release of the minutes: 8:50 on Wednesday, February 3 "
20160129," 1 January 29, 2016 Bank of Japan  Introduction of ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing  with a Negative Interest Rate""  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided to introduce ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with a Negative Interest Rate"" in order to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time.  Going forward, the Bank will pursue monetary easing by making full use of possible measures in terms of three dimensions; quantity, quality, and interest rate. (1) Interest-Rate Dimension: The introduction of a negative interest rate by a 5-4 majority vote[Note 1] The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to current accounts that financial institutions hold at the Bank.1  It will cut the interest rate further into negative territory if judged as necessary. Specifically, the Bank will adopt a three-tier system in which the outstanding balance of each financial institution's current account at the Bank will be divided into three tiers, to each of which a positive interest rate, a zero interest rate, or a negative interest rate will be applied, respectively (see Attachment for details).2  The Bank will carry out the Loan Support Program, the Funds-Supplying Operation to Support Financial Institutions in Disaster Areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake, and the Funds-Supplying Operations against Pooled Collateral at zero interest rates.                                                    1 A negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent will be effective from the reserve maintenance period, which commences from February16, 2016. 2 A multiple-tier system is intended to prevent an excessive decrease in financial institutions' earnings stemming from the implementation of negative interest rates that could weaken their functions as financial intermediaries.  Multiple-tier systems are adopted in countries where the size of negative interest rates is relatively large, including Switzerland (minus 0.75 percent), Sweden (minus 1.1 percent), and Denmark (minus 0.65 percent).  2 (2) Quantity Dimension: The guideline for money market operations The Bank decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period:[Note 2] The Bank of Japan will conduct money market operations so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen. (3) Quality Dimension: The guidelines for asset purchases With regard to the asset purchases, the Bank decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to set the following guidelines:[Note 2] a) The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen.3  With a view to encouraging a decline in interest rates across the entire yield curve, the Bank will conduct purchases in a flexible manner in accordance with financial market conditions.  The average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be about 7-12 years. b) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 3 trillion yen4 and about 90 billion yen, respectively. c) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen, respectively. (4) The continuation of ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate"" The Bank will continue with ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.  It will examine risks to economic activity and prices, and take additional easing measures in terms of three dimensions -- quantity, quality, and interest rate -- if it is judged necessary for achieving the price stability target.[Note 3]                                                    3 As before, the Bank will not set a lower bound for yields on its JGB purchases.  Thus, the Bank can carry out outright purchases of JGBs with negative yields lower than minus 0.1 percent. 4 In addition to the current program of ETF purchases, the Bank will commence purchasing ETFs under a new program from April 2016 at an annual pace of about 300 billion yen, which was decided at the Monetary Policy Meeting on December 17 and 18, 2015.  Under this new program, the Bank will purchase ETFs composed of stocks issued by firms that are proactively investing in physical and human capital.  3 2. Japan's economy has continued to recover moderately, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating in both the household and corporate sectors, and the underlying trend in inflation has been rising steadily.  Recently, however, global financial markets have been volatile against the backdrop of the further decline in crude oil prices and uncertainty such as over future developments in emerging and commodity-exporting economies, particularly the Chinese economy.  For these reasons, there is an increasing risk that an improvement in the business confidence of Japanese firms and conversion of the deflationary mindset might be delayed and that the underlying trend in inflation might be negatively affected. 3. To preempt the manifestation of this risk and to maintain momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent, the Bank decided to introduce ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate.""  The Bank will lower the short end of the yield curve by slashing its deposit rate on current accounts into negative territory and will exert further downward pressure on interest rates across the entire yield curve, in combination with large-scale purchases of JGBs.  In addition, this policy framework is designed to enable the Bank to pursue additional monetary easing in terms of three dimensions, combining a negative interest rate with quantity and quality.  By making full use of ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate,"" the Bank will achieve the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time.                                                      [Note 1] Voting for the action: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Mr. Y. Harada, and Mr. Y. Funo.  Voting against the action: Ms. S. Shirai, Mr. K. Ishida, Mr. T. Sato, and Mr. T. Kiuchi.          The members voting against the action gave the following reasons: Ms. S. Shirai expressed concerns that introducing a negative interest rate immediately after the introduction of supplementary measures for QQE might be misunderstood as reaching a limit to the Bank's asset purchases and that such a complex policy framework could cause confusion; Mr. K. Ishida considered that a further decline in JGB yields would not have significantly positive effects on economic activity; Mr. T. Sato considered that a negative interest rate should be introduced when the Bank slows down the pace of increase in the monetary base; and Mr. T. Kiuchi considered that introduction of a negative interest rate, which would adversely affect smooth conduct of the Bank's JGB purchases, would only be an appropriate policy measure in a crisis situation.   [Note 2] Voting for the action: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Ms. S. Shirai, Mr. K. Ishida,   Mr. T. Sato, Mr. Y. Harada, and Mr. Y. Funo.  Voting against the action: Mr. T. Kiuchi.          Mr. T. Kiuchi proposed that the Bank will conduct money market operations and asset purchases so that the monetary base and the amount outstanding of its JGB holdings will increase at an annual pace of about 45 trillion yen, respectively.  The proposal was defeated by a majority vote.  4                                                                                                                                                                [Note 3] Mr. T. Kiuchi proposed that the Bank will, with the aim to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in the medium to long term, continue with asset purchases and a virtually zero interest rate policy as long as each of these policy measures is deemed appropriate under flexible policy conduct based on the examination from the two perspectives of the monetary policy framework.  The proposal was defeated by an 8-1 majority vote.  Voting for the proposal: Mr. T. Kiuchi.  Voting against the proposal: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Ms. S. Shirai, Mr. K. Ishida,   Mr. T. Sato, Mr. Y. Harada, and Mr. Y. Funo.   5 Attachment  Framework for a Negative Interest Rate on Current Accounts at the Bank  The Bank will adopt a three-tier system in which the outstanding balance of each financial institution's current account at the Bank will be divided into three tiers, to each of which a positive interest rate, a zero interest rate or a negative interest rate will be applied, respectively.5 1. The Three-Tier System (1) Basic Balance: a positive interest rate of 0.1 percent will be applied With regard to the outstanding balance of current account at the Bank that each financial institution accumulated under QQE, the Bank will continue to apply the same interest rate as before.  The average outstanding balance of current account, which each financial institution held during benchmark reserve maintenance periods from January 2015 to December 2015, corresponds to the existing balance and will be regarded as the basic balance to which a positive interest rate of 0.1 percent will be applied.  (2) Macro Add-on Balance: a zero interest rate will be applied A zero interest rate will be applied to the sum of the following amounts outstanding. a) The amount outstanding of the required reserves held by financial institutions subject to the Reserve Requirement System b) The amount outstanding of the Bank's provision of credit through the Loan Support Program and the Funds-Supplying Operation to Support Financial Institutions in Disaster Areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake for financial institutions that are using these programs                                                    5 A negative interest rate is expected to exert its intended effects on financial markets even under the multiple-tier system where a negative interest rate is applied partially.  Transaction prices in financial markets (e.g. interest rates, stock prices, and exchange rates) are determined by marginal losses or gains made in a new transaction.  Although a negative interest rate is not applied to the total outstanding balances of current accounts, costs incurred with an increase in the current account balance brought by a new transaction will be minus 0.1 percent if it is applied to a marginal increase in the current account balance.  Interest rates and asset prices will be determined in financial markets based on that premise.  6 c) The balance calculated as a certain ratio of the amount outstanding of its basic balance in (1) (macro add-on).  The calculation will be made at an appropriate timing, taking account of the fact that the outstanding balances of current accounts at the Bank will increase on an aggregate basis as the asset purchases progress under ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate."" (3) Policy-Rate Balance: a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent will be applied A negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent will be applied to the outstanding balance of each financial institution's current account at the Bank in excess of the amounts outstanding of (1) and (2) combined. 2.  Adjustment concerning a significant increase in financial institutions' cash holdings In order to prevent a decrease in the effects of a negative interest rate due to financial institutions' cash holdings, if their cash holdings increase significantly from those during the benchmark reserve maintenance periods, the increased amount will be deducted from the macro add-on balance in (2).  In cases where the increased amount is larger than the macro add-on balance, the amount in excess of the macro add-on balance will be further deducted from the basic balance in (1).   (Reference) Meeting hours: Thursday, January 28: 14:00-15:46 Friday, January 29: 9:00-12:31 Policy Board members present:    Haruhiko Kuroda (Governor)    Kikuo Iwata (Deputy Governor)    Hiroshi Nakaso (Deputy Governor) Sayuri Shirai Koji Ishida Takehiro Sato Takahide Kiuchi Yutaka Harada Yukitoshi Funo (Others present) January 28 From the Ministry of Finance: Mitsuru Ota, Deputy Vice Minister for Policy Planning and Co-ordination (14:00-15:46) From the Cabinet Office: Masao Nishikawa, Vice-Minister for Policy Coordination (14:00-15:46)  January 29 From the Ministry of Finance: Naoki Okada, State Minister of Finance (9:00-11:50, 12:05-12:31) From the Cabinet Office:  Shuichi Takatori, State Minister of Cabinet Office (9:00-11:50, 12:05-12:31)  Release Dates and Time: Introduction of Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing with a Negative Interest Rate?-- Friday, January 29 at 12:38 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (The Banks View) -- Friday, January 29 at 12:38 Release Schedule: Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report, full text including The Background) -- Saturday, January 30 at 14:00 Summary of Opinions -- Monday, February 8 at 8:50 Minutes -- Friday, March 18 at 8:50 "
20160315," 1 March 15, 2016 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following. (1) Quantity Dimension: The guideline for money market operations The Bank decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period:[Note 1] The Bank of Japan will conduct money market operations so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen. (2) Quality Dimension: The guidelines for asset purchases With regard to the asset purchases, the Bank decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to set the following guidelines:[Note 1] a) The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen.  With a view to encouraging a decline in interest rates across the entire yield curve, the Bank will conduct purchases in a flexible manner in accordance with financial market conditions.  The average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be about 7-12 years. b) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 3 trillion yen until the end of March 2016 and, from April, at an annual pace of about 3.3 trillion yen.1  It will also purchase Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 90 billion yen. c) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen, respectively.                                                    1 Of about 3.3 trillion yen, 300 billion yen will be used in line with the implementation of a new program for purchasing ETFs composed of stocks issued by firms that are proactively investing in physical and human capital, which was decided at the MPM held in December 2015.  2 (3) Interest-Rate Dimension: The policy rate The Bank decided, by a 7-2 majority vote, to continue applying a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank.[Note 2] 2. Japan's economy has continued its moderate recovery trend, although exports and production have been sluggish due mainly to the effects of the slowdown in emerging economies.  Overseas economies have continued to grow at a moderate pace, but the pace of growth has somewhat decelerated mainly in emerging economies.  In this situation, the pick-up in exports has recently paused.  On the domestic demand side, business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend as corporate profits have been at high levels.  Against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation, private consumption has been resilient.  Meanwhile, the pick-up in housing investment has recently paused and public investment has been on a moderate declining trend, albeit remaining at a high level.  Reflecting these developments in demand both at home and abroad, industrial production has continued to be more or less flat.  Financial conditions are highly accommodative.  On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is about 0 percent.  Although inflation expectations appear to be rising on the whole from a somewhat longer-term perspective, they have recently weakened. 3. With regard to the outlook, although sluggishness is expected to remain in exports and production for the time being, domestic demand is likely to follow an uptrend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained in both the household and corporate sectors, and exports are expected to increase moderately on the back of emerging economies moving out of their deceleration phase.  Thus, Japan's economy is likely to be on a moderate expanding trend.  The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to be about 0 percent for the time being, due to the effects of the decline in energy prices, and, as the underlying trend in inflation steadily rises, accelerate toward 2 percent.[Note 3] 4. Risks to the outlook include uncertainties surrounding emerging and commodity-exporting economies, particularly China, developments in the U.S. economy and the influences of its monetary policy response to them on the global financial markets, prospects regarding the European debt problem and the momentum of economic activity and prices in Europe, and geopolitical risks.  Against this backdrop, global financial markets have remained volatile.  Therefore, due attention still needs to be paid to a risk that an improvement in the business  3 confidence of Japanese firms and conversion of the deflationary mindset might be delayed and that the underlying trend in inflation might be negatively affected. 5. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with a Negative Interest Rate,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.  It will examine risks to economic activity and prices, and take additional easing measures in terms of three dimensions -- quantity, quality, and the interest rate -- if it is judged necessary for achieving the price stability target.[Note 4] 6. With a view to implementing ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate"" smoothly, the Bank decided on operational details.  Namely, (1) each financial institution's ""Macro Add-on Balance,"" to which a zero interest rate is applied, will be reviewed every three months in principle; (2) in light of the role of money reserve funds (MRFs) in fund settlement for securities transactions, the amount outstanding of MRFs entrusted to a trust bank will be added to its Macro Add-on Balance (up to the amount outstanding of MRFs entrusted to this trust bank during the previous year); and (3) with the aim of further supporting financial institutions' efforts to increase lending, in case where a financial institution increases the amount outstanding of borrowing from the Bank through the Loan Support Program and the Funds-Supplying Operation to Support Financial Institutions in Disaster Areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake, twice as much as the amount of increase will be added to this financial institution's Macro Add-on Balance.2                                                         2 For details on (1) and (2), see ""Amendment to 'Principal Terms and Conditions of Complementary Deposit Facility'"" released today.  An amendment to the Principal Terms and Conditions in relation to (3) will be made at the next MPM, and it will take effect from the May 2016 reserve maintenance period.  As decided at the MPM held last January, with regard to the existing amount of borrowing from the Bank through these facilities, the corresponding amount of current account balance will be added to the Macro Add-on Balance.  In case where a financial institution decreases the amount outstanding of such borrowing, an amount equivalent to the decrease will be deducted from that Balance.  4                                                    [Note 1] Voting for the action: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Ms. S. Shirai, Mr. K. Ishida,   Mr. T. Sato, Mr. Y. Harada, and Mr. Y. Funo.  Voting against the action: Mr. T. Kiuchi.          Mr. T. Kiuchi proposed that the Bank will conduct money market operations and asset purchases so that the monetary base and the amount outstanding of its JGB holdings will increase at an annual pace of about 45 trillion yen, respectively.  The proposal was defeated by a majority vote. [Note 2] Voting for the action: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Ms. S. Shirai, Mr. K. Ishida,   Mr. Y. Harada, and Mr. Y. Funo.  Voting against the action: Mr. T. Sato and Mr. T. Kiuchi.          Mr. T. Kiuchi dissented considering that an interest rate of 0.1 percent should be applied to current account balances excluding the amount outstanding of the required reserves held by financial institutions at the Bank, because negative interest rates would impair the functioning of financial markets and financial intermediation as well as the stability in the JGB market.  Mr. T. Sato proposed that the Bank will apply an interest rate of 0.1 percent to current account balances excluding the amount outstanding of the required reserves held by financial institutions at the Bank while maintaining the three-tier system and that it will carry out the Loan Support Program and other funds-supplying operations at an interest rate of 0.1 percent.  The proposal was defeated by a majority vote. [Note 3] Mr. T. Kiuchi submitted a proposal concerning an outlook that the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to be about 0 percent for the time being, and thereafter accelerate very moderately.  The proposal was defeated by an 8-1 majority vote.  Voting for the proposal: Mr. T. Kiuchi.  Voting against the proposal: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Ms. S. Shirai, Mr. K.

The average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be about 7-12 years. b) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 3.3 trillion yen1 and about 90 billion yen, respectively. c) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen, respectively.                                                    1 Of about 3.3 trillion yen, 300 billion yen is used in line with the implementation of a program for purchasing ETFs composed of stocks issued by firms that are proactively investing in physical and human capital, as decided at the MPM held in December 2015.  2 (3) Interest-Rate Dimension: The policy rate The Bank decided, by a 7-2 majority vote, to continue applying a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank.[Note 2] 2. In addition, with a view to supporting financial institutions in disaster areas affected by the Kumamoto Earthquake in their efforts toward meeting demand for funds for restoration and rebuilding, the Bank decided by a unanimous vote to introduce a funds-supplying operation for these financial institutions. The specifics of this operation are the following: the total amount of loans is set at 300 billion yen; the Bank will provide loans at a zero interest rate; and twice as much as the amount outstanding of financial institutions' borrowing through this operation will be added to their Macro Add-on Balances, to which a zero interest rate is applied.                                                      [Note 1] Voting for the action: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Mr. K. Ishida, Mr. T. Sato,    Mr. Y. Harada, Mr. Y. Funo, and Mr. M. Sakurai. Voting against the action: Mr. T. Kiuchi.        Mr. T. Kiuchi proposed that the Bank will conduct money market operations and asset purchases so that the monetary base and the amount outstanding of its JGB holdings will increase at an annual pace of about 45 trillion yen, respectively. The proposal was defeated by a majority vote. [Note 2] Voting for the action: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Mr. K. Ishida, Mr. Y. Harada,  Mr. Y. Funo, and Mr. M. Sakurai.

Kiuchi dissented considering that an interest rate of 0.1 percent should be applied to current account balances excluding the amount outstanding of the required reserves held by financial institutions at the Bank, because negative interest rates would impair the functioning of financial markets and financial intermediation as well as the stability of the JGB market.     (Reference) Meeting hours: Wednesday, April 27: 14:00-16:01 Thursday, April 28: 9:00-11:54 Policy Board members present:    Haruhiko Kuroda (Governor)    Kikuo Iwata (Deputy Governor)    Hiroshi Nakaso (Deputy Governor) Koji Ishida Takehiro Sato Takahide Kiuchi Yutaka Harada Yukitoshi Funo Makoto Sakurai (Others present) April 27 From the Ministry of Finance: Mitsuru Ota, Deputy Vice Minister for Policy Planning and Co-ordination (14:00-16:01) From the Cabinet Office: Masao Nishikawa, Vice-Minister for Policy Coordination (14:00-16:01)  April 28 From the Ministry of Finance: Manabu Sakai, State Minister of Finance (9:00-11:21, 11:31-11:54) From the Cabinet Office:  Masao Nishikawa, Vice-Minister for Policy Coordination (9:00-11:21, 11:31-11:54)  Release Dates and Time: Statement on Monetary Policy -- Thursday, April 28 at 12:01 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (The Banks View) -- Thursday, April 28 at 12:01 Release Schedule: Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report, full text including The Background) -- Friday, April 29 at 14:00 Summary of Opinions -- Thursday, May 12 at 8:50 Minutes -- Tuesday, June 21 at 8:50 "
20160616," 1 June 16, 2016 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following. (1) Quantity Dimension: The guideline for money market operations The Bank decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period:[Note 1] The Bank of Japan will conduct money market operations so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen. (2) Quality Dimension: The guidelines for asset purchases With regard to the asset purchases, the Bank decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to set the following guidelines:[Note 1] a) The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen. With a view to encouraging a decline in interest rates across the entire yield curve, the Bank will conduct purchases in a flexible manner in accordance with financial market conditions. The average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be about 7-12 years. b) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 3.3 trillion yen1 and about 90 billion yen, respectively. c) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen, respectively.                                                    1 Of about 3.3 trillion yen, 300 billion yen is used in line with the implementation of a program for purchasing ETFs composed of stocks issued by firms that are proactively investing in physical and human capital, as decided at the MPM held in December 2015.  2 (3) Interest-Rate Dimension: The policy rate The Bank decided, by a 7-2 majority vote, to continue applying a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank.[Note 2] 2. Japan's economy has continued its moderate recovery trend, although exports and production have been sluggish due mainly to the effects of the slowdown in emerging economies. Overseas economies have continued to grow at a moderate pace, but the pace of growth has somewhat decelerated mainly in emerging economies. In this situation, the pick-up in exports has paused. On the domestic demand side, business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend as corporate profits have been at high levels. Against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation, private consumption has been resilient, although relatively weak developments have been seen in some indicators. Housing investment has resumed its pick-up, and the pace of decline in public investment has been slowing. Reflecting these developments in demand both at home and abroad and the effects of the Kumamoto Earthquake, industrial production has continued to be more or less flat. Financial conditions are highly accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is about 0 percent. Although inflation expectations appear to be rising on the whole from a somewhat longer-term perspective, they have recently weakened. 3. With regard to the outlook, although sluggishness is expected to remain in exports and production for the time being, domestic demand is likely to follow an uptrend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained in both the household and corporate sectors, and exports are expected to increase moderately on the back of emerging economies moving out of their deceleration phase. Thus, Japan's economy is likely to be on a moderate expanding trend. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to be slightly negative or about 0 percent for the time being, due to the effects of the decline in energy prices, and, as the underlying trend in inflation steadily rises, accelerate toward 2 percent. [Note 3] 4. Risks to the outlook include uncertainties surrounding emerging and commodity-exporting economies, particularly China, developments in the U.S. economy and the influences of its monetary policy response to them on the global financial markets, prospects regarding the European debt problem and the momentum of economic activity and prices in Europe, and geopolitical risks. Against this backdrop, global financial markets have remained volatile. Therefore, due attention still needs to be paid to the risk that an improvement in the business  3 confidence of Japanese firms and conversion of the deflationary mindset might be delayed and that the underlying trend in inflation might be negatively affected. 5. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with a Negative Interest Rate,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will examine risks to economic activity and prices, and take additional easing measures in terms of three dimensions -- quantity, quality, and the interest rate -- if it is judged necessary for achieving the price stability target.[Note 4]                                                      [Note 1] Voting for the action: Mr. H.

[Note 3] Mr. T.

20160729," 1 July 29, 2016 Bank of Japan  Enhancement of Monetary Easing  1. Against the backdrop of the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union and the slowdown in emerging economies, uncertainties surrounding overseas economies have increased and volatile developments have continued in the global financial markets. In order to prevent these uncertainties from leading to a deterioration in business confidence and consumer sentiment as well as to ensure smooth funding in foreign currencies by Japanese firms and financial institutions, thereby supporting their proactive economic activities, at the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following. (1) An increase in purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by a 7-2 majority vote[Note 1] The Bank will purchase ETFs so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 6 trillion yen1 (almost double the previous pace of about 3.3 trillion yen).  (2) Measures to ensure smooth funding in foreign currencies by Japanese firms and financial institutions by a unanimous vote a) Increasing the size of the Bank's lending program to support growth in U.S. dollars  The Bank will increase the size of its lending program to support growth in U.S. dollars (the Special Rules for the U.S. Dollar Lending Arrangement to Enhance the Fund-Provisioning Measure to Support Strengthening the Foundations for Economic Growth Conducted through the Loan Support Program) to 24 billion USD (about 2.5 trillion yen; double the previous size of 12 billion USD). Under this lending program, the Bank provides its U.S. dollar funds for a period of up to 4 years to support Japanese firms' overseas activities through financial institutions.                                                    1 Of about 6 trillion yen, 300 billion yen is used in line with the implementation of a program for purchasing ETFs composed of stocks issued by firms that are proactively investing in physical and human capital, as decided at the MPM held in December 2015.  2 b) Establishing a new facility for lending securities to be pledged as collateral for the U.S. Dollar Funds-Supplying Operations The Bank will establish a new facility in which it lends Japanese government securities (JGSs) to financial institutions against their current account balances with the Bank so that these JGSs can be pledged as collateral for the U.S. Dollar Funds-Supplying Operations.  2. With regard to the guideline for money market operations, the guidelines for asset purchases except for ETF purchases, and the policy rate, the Bank decided to leave these unchanged. (1) Quantity Dimension: The guideline for money market operations The Bank decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to set the following guideline for money market operations for the intermeeting period:[Note 2] The Bank of Japan will conduct money market operations so that the monetary base will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen. (2) Quality Dimension: The guidelines for asset purchases With regard to the asset purchases, the Bank decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to set the following guidelines:[Note 2] a) The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen. With a view to encouraging a decline in interest rates across the entire yield curve, the Bank will conduct purchases in a flexible manner in accordance with financial market conditions. The average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be about 7-12 years. b) The Bank will purchase Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 90 billion yen. c) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen, respectively.  3 (3) Interest-Rate Dimension: The policy rate The Bank decided, by a 7-2 majority vote, to continue applying a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank.[Note 3] 3. The Government is undertaking fiscal and structural policy initiatives, including a large-scale ""stimulus package,"" which is currently being compiled. The Bank will pursue ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with a Negative Interest Rate"" including measures decided today and provide highly accommodative financial conditions. The Bank believes that these monetary policy measures and the Government's initiatives will produce synergy effects on the economy. 4. The Bank will continue with ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will examine risks to economic activity and prices, and take additional easing measures in terms of three dimensions -- quantity, quality, and the interest rate -- if it is judged necessary for achieving the price stability target.[Note 4] 5. As shown in the July 2016 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report) released today, there is considerable uncertainty over the outlook for prices against the background of uncertainties surrounding overseas economies and global financial markets. Against this backdrop, with a view to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time, the Bank will conduct a comprehensive assessment of the developments in economic activity and prices under ""QQE"" and ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate"" as well as these policy effects at the next MPM. The Chairman instructed the staff to prepare for deliberations at the next meeting.                                                      [Note 1] Voting for the action: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Mr. Y. Harada, Mr. Y. Funo,   Mr. M. Sakurai, and Ms. T. Masai. Voting against the action: Mr. T. Sato and Mr. T. Kiuchi.      Mr. T. Sato dissented considering that ETF purchases of about 6 trillion yen annually would be excessive in light of their adverse impact on the price mechanism in the stock market and the Bank's financial soundness. Mr. T. Kiuchi dissented because an increase in ETF purchases would (1) impair the Bank's financial soundness, (2) lead to a rise in volatility in the stock market, and (3) give a wrong impression that the Bank targeted stock prices.  4                                                                                                                                                                [Note 2] Voting for the action: Mr. H.

Kiuchi proposed that the Bank conduct money market operations and asset purchases so that the monetary base and the amount outstanding of its JGB holdings increase at an annual pace of about 45 trillion yen, respectively. The proposal was defeated by a majority vote. [Note 3] Voting for the action: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Mr. Y. Harada, Mr. Y. Funo,   Mr. M. Sakurai, and Ms. T. Masai.

20160921," 1 September 21, 2016 Bank of Japan  New Framework for Strengthening Monetary Easing: ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing with Yield Curve Control""  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan conducted a comprehensive assessment of the developments in economic activity and prices under ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE)"" and ""QQE with a Negative Interest Rate"" as well as their policy effects, and compiled ""The Bank's View"" as provided in Attachment 1. The Policy Board's view on the current situation of and outlook for economic activity and prices is provided in Attachment 2. 2. Based on these, with a view to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time, the Bank decided to introduce ""QQE with Yield Curve Control"" by strengthening the two previous policy frameworks mentioned above. The new policy framework consists of two major components: the first is ""yield curve control"" in which the Bank will control short-term and long-term interest rates; and the second is an ""inflation-overshooting commitment"" in which the Bank commits itself to expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed consumer price index (CPI) exceeds the price stability target of 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. Specifically, the Bank decided upon the following. (1) Yield curve control  a) Guideline for market operations (by a 7-2 majority vote)[Note 1] The guideline for market operations specifies a short-term policy interest rate and a target level of a long-term interest rate. The Bank decided to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period. The Bank will cut the interest rates further if judged necessary. The short-term policy interest rate:  The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank.  2 The long-term interest rate:  The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that 10-year JGB yields will remain more or less at the current level (around zero percent). With regard to the amount of JGBs to be purchased, the Bank will conduct purchases more or less in line with the current pace -- an annual pace of increase in the amount outstanding of its JGB holdings at about 80 trillion yen -- aiming to achieve the target level of a long-term interest rate specified by the guideline. JGBs with a wide range of maturities will continue to be eligible for purchase, while the guideline for average remaining maturity of the Bank's JGB purchases will be abolished. b) New tools of market operations for facilitating yield curve control (by an 8-1 majority vote)[Note 2] The Bank decided to introduce the following new tools of market operations so as to control the yield curve smoothly. (i) Outright purchases of JGBs with yields designated by the Bank (fixed-rate purchase operations)1 (ii) Fixed-rate funds-supplying operations for a period of up to 10 years (extending  the longest maturity of the operation from 1 year at present)  (2) Guidelines for asset purchases  With regard to asset purchases except for JGB purchases, the Bank decided, by a 7-2 majority vote, to set the following guidelines.[Note 3] a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 6 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen, respectively. b) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen, respectively.                                                    1 In case of a spike in interest rates, the Bank stands ready to conduct fixed-rate JGB purchase operations -- for example, those with regard to 10-year and 20-year JGB yields -- in order to prevent the yield curve from deviating substantially from the current levels.   3 (3) Inflation-overshooting commitment[Note 4]  The Bank will continue with ""QQE with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. The Bank will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds the price stability target of 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. Meanwhile, the pace of increase in the monetary base may fluctuate in the short run under market operations which aim at controlling the yield curve. With the Bank maintaining this stance, the ratio of the monetary base to nominal GDP in Japan is expected to exceed 100 percent (about 500 trillion yen) in slightly over one year (at present, about 80 percent in Japan compared with about 20 percent in the United States and the euro area). The Bank will make policy adjustments as appropriate, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, with a view to maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent. 3. In light of the findings of the comprehensive assessment, the thinking behind the newly introduced policy framework is as follows. (1) Background to the introduction of yield curve control As shown in the comprehensive assessment, QQE has brought about improvements in economic activity and prices mainly through the decline in real interest rates, and Japan's economy is no longer in deflation, which is commonly defined as a sustained decline in prices. With this in mind, ""yield curve control,"" in which the Bank will seek for the decline in real interest rates by controlling short-term and long-term interest rates, would be placed at the core of the new policy framework.   The experience so far with the negative interest rate policy shows that a combination of the negative interest rate on current account balances at the Bank and JGB purchases is effective for yield curve control. In addition, the Bank decided to introduce new tools of market operations which will facilitate smooth implementation of yield curve control.   4 (2) Measures to raise inflation expectations  The price stability target of 2 percent has not been achieved. In the course of the Bank's attempt to raise inflation expectations toward 2 percent, observed inflation rates declined due to a variety of exogenous factors such as a fall in crude oil prices. Under these circumstances, inflation expectations declined, as the adaptive mechanism has been playing a relatively large role in the formation of inflation expectations in Japan. This seems to be the main factor that hampers achieving the price stability target of 2 percent. In order to address this situation, the Bank judged it necessary to adopt measures that will raise inflation expectations in a more forceful manner.  First, the Bank decided to adopt a commitment that allows inflation to overshoot the price stability target so as to strengthen the ""forward-looking mechanism"" in the formation of inflation expectations. Achieving the price stability target means attaining a situation where the inflation rate is 2 percent on average over the business cycle. Given the fact that both observed and expected inflation rates are below 2 percent currently, the Bank judged it appropriate to enhance the credibility for the price stability target among the public by committing itself to ""expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI exceeds the price stability target of 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner."" Second, it is necessary to have momentum in order to shift peoples' deflationary mindset which had been entrenched amid the prolonged period of deflation. Thus, the Bank adheres to its commitment to achieving the 2 percent inflation ""at the earliest possible time."" Meanwhile, a further rise in inflation expectations through the adaptive mechanism is uncertain and may take time. Considering these, the Bank judged it appropriate to adopt a new policy framework with the mechanisms for yield curve control placed at the core that enables the Bank to make more flexible adjustments according to developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions and that enhances the sustainability of monetary easing. (3) Possible options for additional easing  With regard to possible options for additional easing, the Bank can cut the short-term policy interest rate and the target level of a long-term interest rate, which are two key benchmark rates for yield curve control. It is also possible for the Bank to expand asset  5 purchases as has been the case since the introduction of QQE. Moreover, if the situation warrants it, an acceleration of expansion of the monetary base may also be an option. 4. In January 2013, the Government and the Bank released the joint statement, which sets out that both parties strengthen their policy coordination and work together in order to overcome deflation early and achieve sustainable economic growth with price stability. The Bank will pursue ""QQE with Yield Curve Control"" and achieve the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time. The Bank believes that its monetary policy and the Government's fiscal policy as well as initiatives for strengthening Japan's growth potential will produce synergy effects, and thereby will navigate Japan's economy toward overcoming deflation and achieving sustainable growth.[Note 4]                                                      [Note 1] Voting for the action: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Mr. Y. Harada, Mr. Y. Funo,   Mr. M. Sakurai, and Ms. T. Masai. Voting against the action: Mr. T. Sato and Mr. T. Kiuchi.       Mr. T. Sato dissented considering that setting the short-term policy rate at minus 0.1 percent and the target level of 10-year JGB yields at around 0 percent could lead to holding JGB yields in negative territory up to a maturity of 10 years and thus could have an adverse impact on the functioning of financial intermediation. Mr. T. Kiuchi dissented considering that, with a view to maintaining the stability of the JGB market and the functioning of financial intermediation, (1) the short-term policy interest rate should be set at 0.1 percent and (2) the adoption of a target level of a long-term interest rate was not appropriate because it would entail a risk that the Bank might need to further increase a pace of its JGB purchases.

Kiuchi.         Mr. T. Kiuchi dissented because the new tools of market operations could impair the functioning of the JGB market and could distort the pricing mechanism in overall financial markets.

Kiuchi.      Mr. T. Sato dissented considering that ETF purchases of about 6 trillion yen annually would be excessive in light of their adverse impact on the pricing mechanism in the stock market and the Bank's financial soundness. Mr. T. Kiuchi proposed that the Bank continue to use amounts of asset purchases as its operating targets and set the guidelines for asset purchases in which the Bank would purchase JGBs so that their amount outstanding would increase at an annual pace of about 45 trillion yen, purchase ETFs so that their amount outstanding would increase at an annual pace of about 1 trillion yen, and so on. The proposal was defeated by a majority vote. [Note 4] Mr. T. Sato opposed the ""inflation-overshooting commitment"" regarding an expansion of the monetary base considering that this was not a realistic target and would not be effective.         Mr. T. Kiuchi proposed that Section 2.(3) be deleted and that the Bank aim at achieving the price stability target of 2 percent in the medium to long term in its future conduct of monetary policy. The proposal was defeated by an 8-1 majority vote. Voting for the proposal: Mr. T. Kiuchi. Voting against the proposal: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Mr. T. Sato, Mr. Y. Harada, Mr. Y. Funo, Mr. M. Sakurai, and Ms. T.

Comprehensive Assessment A. Transmission Mechanism of QQE QQE has lowered real interest rates by raising inflation expectations and pushing down nominal interest rates. Although the natural rate of interest has followed a downward trend, real interest rates have been well below the natural rate of interest, leading to an improvement in financial conditions. As a result, economic activity and price developments improved, and Japan's economy is no longer in deflation, which is commonly defined as a sustained decline in prices.  B. Factors That Have Hampered Achieving the 2 Percent Price Stability Target However, the price stability target of 2 percent has not been achieved. In terms of the mechanism described above, this is largely due to developments in inflation expectations. The following two factors have played a role in the development of inflation expectations. First, exogenous developments, including (1) the decline in crude oil prices, (2) the weakness in demand following the consumption tax hike in April 2014, and (3) the slowdown in emerging economies and volatile global financial markets, have lowered the observed inflation rate. And second, amid this decline in the observed inflation rate, inflation expectations -- after having been largely flat -- weakened, reflecting the fact that expectations formation in Japan is largely adaptive, that is, backward-looking.  C. The Mechanism of Inflation Expectations Formation Inflation expectations need to be raised further in order to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent. However, it should be noted that, since the observed inflation rate is likely to remain subdued for the time being, a further rise in inflation expectations through the  7 adaptive mechanism is uncertain and may take time. This highlights the important role played by the forward-looking expectations formation mechanism.  The expansion of the monetary base, together with the commitment to achieving the price stability target and the Bank's purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGBs), by bringing about a regime change in monetary policy, has transformed peoples' perceptions of inflation and has led to a rise in inflation expectations. The relationship between the monetary base and inflation expectations seems to be of a long-run rather than a short-run nature. Therefore, what is important is the Bank's commitment to expanding the monetary base in the long run.  D. Pushing Down the Yield Curve through the Negative Interest Rate and JGB Purchases The negative interest rate policy introduced by the Bank in January 2016, in combination with JGB purchases, has pushed down not only short-term but also long-term interest rates substantially. This shows that the combination of these policy measures is an effective means for the central bank to exert influence on the entire yield curve.  E. The Effects and Impact of the Decline in the Yield Curve  The decline in JGB yields has translated into a decline in lending rates as well as interest rates on corporate bonds and CP. Financial institutions' lending attitudes continue to be proactive. Thus, so far, financial conditions have become more accommodative under the negative interest rate policy. However, because the decline in lending rates has been brought about by reducing financial institutions' lending margins, the extent to which a further decline in the yield curve will lead to a decline in lending rates depends on financial institutions' lending stance going forward.  The impact of interest rates on economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions depends on the shape of the yield curve. In this regard, the following three points warrant attention. First, short- and medium-term interest rates have a larger impact on economic activity than longer-term rates. Second, the link between the impact of interest rates and the shape of the yield curve may change as firms explore new ways of raising funds such as  8 issuing super-long-term corporate bonds under the current monetary easing, including the negative interest rate policy. Third, an excessive decline and flattening of the yield curve may have a negative impact on economic activity by leading to a deterioration in people's sentiment, as it can cause uncertainty about the sustainability of financial functioning in a broader sense.  II. Directions for Monetary Policy Suggested by the Comprehensive Assessment These findings of the comprehensive assessment suggest the following directions for monetary policy.  (1) Inflation expectations need to be raised further in order to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent. Given that a further rise in inflation expectations through the adaptive mechanism is uncertain and may take time, measures to strengthen the forward-looking expectations formation mechanism are warranted. At the same time, the Bank needs to adopt measures that enable the Bank to make flexible adjustments according to developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions and that enhances the sustainability of monetary easing. (2) The Bank should commit itself to expanding the monetary base in the long run. (3) The Bank can exert influence on interest rates along the entire yield curve through the appropriate combination of a negative interest rate and JGB purchases. (4) To work toward the formation of an appropriate yield curve, the Bank should take account of economic, price, and financial conditions, including (i) the extent to which a decline in JGB yields translates into a decline in lending and corporate bond rates, (ii) the effects of a decline in JGB yields on economic activity, and (iii) the impact of a decline in JGB yields on financial functioning.                                                   [Note 5] Voting for the proposal: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Mr. Y. Harada,      Mr. Y. Funo, Mr. M. Sakurai, and Ms. T. Masai. Voting against the proposal: Mr. T. Sato and Mr. T. Kiuchi. Mr. T. Sato opposed the expressions such as ""the relationship between the monetary base and inflation expectations seems to be of a long-run rather than a short-run nature."" Mr. T. Kiuchi dissented because the comprehensive assessment (1) did not examine a decline in sustainability of the Bank's JGB purchases and an increasing risk to the Bank's financial soundness and (2) differed from his own view regarding price determination mechanisms and achievement of the price stability target.  9 Attachment 2  Current Situation of and Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices in Japan  1. Japan's economy has continued its moderate recovery trend, although exports and production have been sluggish due mainly to the effects of the slowdown in emerging economies. Overseas economies have continued to grow at a moderate pace, but the pace of growth has somewhat decelerated mainly in emerging economies. In this situation, exports have been more or less flat. On the domestic demand side, business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend as corporate profits have been at high levels. Against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation, private consumption has been resilient, although relatively weak developments have been seen in some indicators. Housing investment has continued picking up, and the decline in public investment has leveled off. Reflecting these developments in demand both at home and abroad, industrial production has continued to be more or less flat. Financial conditions are highly accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) has been slightly negative. Although inflation expectations appear to be rising on the whole from a somewhat longer-term perspective, they have recently weakened. 2. With regard to the outlook, sluggishness is expected to remain in exports and production for some time, and the pace of economic recovery is likely to remain slow. Thereafter, domestic demand is likely to follow an uptrend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained in both the household and corporate sectors, and exports are expected to head toward a moderate increase as overseas economies move out of their deceleration phase. Thus, Japan's economy is likely to be on a moderate expanding trend. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to be slightly negative or about 0 percent for the time being, due to the effects of the decline in energy prices, and, as the underlying trend in inflation steadily rises, accelerate toward 2 percent.[Note 6] 3. Risks to the outlook include the impact that uncertainties associated with the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union would have on the global financial markets and global economy, uncertainties surrounding emerging and commodity-exporting economies, particularly China, developments in the U.S. economy and the impact of its monetary policy on global financial markets, prospects regarding the European debt problem -- including the  10 financial sector -- and the momentum of economic activity and prices in Europe, and geopolitical risks.

Kiuchi.      Mr. T. Kiuchi opposed the expression that the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI was likely to accelerate toward 2 percent.   (Reference) Meeting hours: Tuesday, September 20: 14:00-16:04 Wednesday, September 21: 9:00-12:58 Policy Board members present:    Haruhiko Kuroda (Governor)    Kikuo Iwata (Deputy Governor)    Hiroshi Nakaso (Deputy Governor) Takehiro Sato Takahide Kiuchi Yutaka Harada Yukitoshi Funo Makoto Sakurai Takako Masai (Others present) September 20 From the Ministry of Finance: Mitsuru Ota, Deputy Vice Minister for Policy Planning and Co-ordination (14:00-16:04) From the Cabinet Office: Shigeki Habuka, Vice-Minister for Policy Coordination (14:00-16:04)  September 21 From the Ministry of Finance: Taku Otsuka, State Minister of Finance (9:00-12:18, 12:39-12:58) From the Cabinet Office:  Takao Ochi, State Minister of Cabinet Office (9:00-12:18, 12:39-12:58)  Release Dates and Time: New Framework for Strengthening Monetary Easing: ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing with Yield Curve Control"" -- Wednesday, September 21 at 13:18 Release Schedule: Summary of Opinions -- Friday, September 30 at 8:50 Minutes -- Monday, November 7 at 8:50 "
20161101," 1 November 1, 2016 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following. (1) Yield curve control  The Bank decided, by a 7-2 majority vote, to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period. [Note 1] The short-term policy interest rate:  The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The long-term interest rate:  The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. With regard to the amount of JGBs to be purchased, the Bank will conduct purchases at more or less the current pace -- an annual pace of increase in the amount outstanding of its JGB holdings of about 80 trillion yen -- aiming to achieve the target level of the long-term interest rate specified by the guideline. (2) Guidelines for asset purchases  With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided, by a 7-2 majority vote, to set the following guidelines. [Note 2] a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 6 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen, respectively. b) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen, respectively.   2                                                    [Note 1] Voting for the action: Mr. H.

Japan's economy has continued its moderate recovery trend. Overseas economies have continued to grow at a moderate pace, although emerging economies remain sluggish in part. In this situation, exports have picked up. On the domestic demand side, business fixed  2 investment has been on a moderate increasing trend as corporate profits have been at high levels and business sentiment has improved somewhat. Against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation, private consumption has been resilient, and housing investment has continued its pick-up. In the meantime, public investment has been more or less flat. Reflecting these moderate increases in demand both at home and abroad and the progress in inventory adjustments, industrial production has picked up. Financial conditions are highly accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) has been slightly negative. Inflation expectations have remained in a weakening phase. 3. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to turn to a moderate expansion. Domestic demand is likely to follow an uptrend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained in both the corporate and household sectors, on the back of highly accommodative financial conditions and fiscal spending through the government's large-scale stimulus measures. Exports are expected to follow a moderate increasing trend on the back of an improvement in overseas economies. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to be slightly negative or about 0 percent for the time being, due to the effects of the decline in energy prices, and as the output gap improves and medium- to long-term inflation expectations rise, it is expected to increase toward 2 percent. [Note 3] 4. Risks to the outlook include the following: developments in emerging and commodity-exporting economies, particularly China; developments in the U.S. economy and the impact of its monetary policy on global financial markets; the consequences stemming from the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union (EU) and their effects; prospects regarding the European debt problem, including the financial sector; and geopolitical risks. 5. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will make policy adjustments as appropriate, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, with a view to maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target.

The proposal was defeated by a majority vote. (Reference) Meeting hours: Monday, January 30: 14:00 -16:09 Tuesday, January 31: 9:00-11:49 Policy Board members present:    Haruhiko Kuroda (Governor)    Kikuo Iwata (Deputy Governor)    Hiroshi Nakaso (Deputy Governor) Takehiro Sato Takahide Kiuchi Yutaka Harada Yukitoshi Funo Makoto Sakurai Takako Masai (Others present) January 30 From the Ministry of Finance: Mitsuru Ota, Deputy Vice Minister for Policy Planning and Co-ordination (14:00-16:09) From the Cabinet Office: Shigeki Habuka, Vice-Minister for Policy Coordination (14:00-16:09)  January 31 From the Ministry of Finance: Minoru Kihara, State Minister of Finance (9:00-11:14, 11:25-11:49) From the Cabinet Office:  Takao Ochi, State Minister of Cabinet Office (9:00-11:14, 11:25-11:49)  Release Dates and Time: Statement on Monetary Policy -- Tuesday, January 31 at 11:56 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (The Banks View) -- Tuesday, January 31 at 11:56 Release Schedule: Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report, full text including The Background) -- Wednesday, February 1 at 14:00 Summary of Opinions -- Wednesday, February 8 at 8:50 Minutes -- Wednesday, March 22 at 8:50 "
20170316," 1 March 16, 2017 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following. (1) Yield curve control The Bank decided, by a 7-2 majority vote, to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period. [Note 1] The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The long-term interest rate: The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. With regard to the amount of JGBs to be purchased, the Bank will conduct purchases at more or less the current pace -- an annual pace of increase in the amount outstanding of its JGB holdings of about 80 trillion yen -- aiming to achieve the target level of the long-term interest rate specified by the guideline. (2) Guidelines for asset purchases With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided, by a 7-2 majority vote, to set the following guidelines. [Note 2] a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 6 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen, respectively. b) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen, respectively. 2. Japan's economy has continued its moderate recovery trend. Overseas economies have continued to grow at a moderate pace, although emerging economies remain sluggish in part. In this situation, exports have picked up. On the domestic demand side, business fixed  2 investment has been on a moderate increasing trend as corporate profits have improved. Private consumption has been resilient against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation. Meanwhile, housing investment and public investment have been more or less flat. Reflecting these moderate increases in demand both at home and abroad and the progress in inventory adjustments, industrial production has picked up. Financial conditions are highly accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) has been about 0 percent. Inflation expectations have remained in a weakening phase. 3. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to turn to a moderate expansion. Domestic demand is likely to follow an uptrend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained in both the corporate and household sectors, on the back of highly accommodative financial conditions and fiscal spending through the government's large-scale stimulus measures. Exports are expected to follow a moderate increasing trend on the back of an improvement in overseas economies. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase from about 0 percent and become slightly positive, reflecting developments in energy prices. Thereafter, it is expected to increase toward 2 percent as the output gap improves and medium- to long-term inflation expectations rise. [Note 3] 4. Risks to the outlook include the following: developments in the U.S. economy and the impact of its monetary policy on global financial markets; developments in emerging and commodity-exporting economies, particularly China; the consequences stemming from the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union (EU) and their effects; prospects regarding the European debt problem, including the financial sector; and geopolitical risks. 5. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will make policy adjustments as appropriate, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, with a view to maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target.

Masai. Voting against the action: Mr. T. Sato and Mr. T. Kiuchi.       Mr. T. Sato dissented considering that setting the short-term policy interest rate at minus 0.1 percent and the target level of 10-year JGB yields at around 0 percent could lead to holding JGB yields in negative territory up to a maturity of 10 years and thus could have an adverse impact on the functioning of financial intermediation. Mr. T. Kiuchi dissented considering that, with a view to maintaining the stability of the JGB market and the functioning of financial intermediation, (1) the short-term policy interest rate should be set at 0.1 percent and (2) the adoption of a target level for a long-term interest rate was not appropriate because it would entail a risk that the Bank might need to further increase the pace of its JGB purchases.  [Note 2] Voting for the action: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Mr. Y. Harada, Mr. Y. Funo,   Mr. M. Sakurai, and Ms. T. Masai. Voting against the action: Mr. T. Sato and Mr. T. Kiuchi.      Mr. T. Sato dissented considering that ETF purchases of about 6 trillion yen annually would be excessive in light of their adverse impact on the pricing mechanism in the stock market and the Bank's financial soundness. Mr. T. Kiuchi proposed that the Bank continue to use amounts of asset purchases as its operating targets and set the guidelines for asset purchases as follows: the Bank would purchase JGBs so that their amount outstanding would increase at an annual pace of about 45 trillion yen, purchase ETFs so that their amount outstanding would increase at an annual pace of about 1 trillion yen, and so on. The proposal was defeated by a majority vote. [Note 3] Mr. T. Kiuchi proposed, concerning the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI, that it was likely to increase from about 0 percent and become slightly positive, and would thereafter increase very moderately. The proposal was defeated by an 8-1 majority vote. Voting for the proposal:         Mr. T. Kiuchi. Voting against the proposal: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Mr. T. Sato, Mr. Y. Harada, Mr. Y. Funo, Mr. M. Sakurai, and Ms. T. Masai. [Note 4] Mr. T. Sato opposed the commitment to expanding the monetary base, considering that this was neither realistic nor effective. Mr. T. Kiuchi proposed that the Bank, with the aim to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent in the medium to long term, continue with asset purchases and a virtually zero short-term interest rate policy as long as each of these policy measures was deemed appropriate. The proposal was defeated by an 8-1 majority vote. Voting for the proposal: Mr. T. Kiuchi. Voting against the proposal: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. K. Iwata, Mr. H. Nakaso, Mr. T. Sato, Mr. Y. Harada,    Mr. Y. Funo, Mr. M. Sakurai, and Ms. T.

Japan's economy is expanding moderately, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating. Overseas economies have continued to grow at a moderate pace on the whole. In this situation, exports have been on an increasing trend. On the domestic demand side,  2 business fixed investment has been on a moderate increasing trend with corporate profits improving.

Meanwhile, public investment has been increasing and housing investment has been more or less flat. Reflecting these increases in demand both at home and abroad, industrial production has been on an increasing trend, and labor market conditions have continued to tighten steadily. Financial conditions are highly accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is around 0.5 percent. Inflation expectations have remained in a weakening phase. 3. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to continue its moderate expansion. Domestic demand is likely to follow an uptrend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained in both the corporate and household sectors, on the back of highly accommodative financial conditions and fiscal spending through the government's large-scale stimulus measures. Exports are expected to continue their moderate increasing trend on the back of the improvement in overseas economies. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to continue on an uptrend and increase toward 2 percent, mainly on the back of an improvement in the output gap and a rise in medium- to long-term inflation expectations.

Risks to the outlook include the following: the U.S. economic policies and their impact on global financial markets; developments in emerging and commodity-exporting economies; negotiations on the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (EU) and their effects; prospects regarding the European debt problem, including the financial sector; and geopolitical risks. 5. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will make policy adjustments as appropriate, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, with a view to maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target.   3                                                    [Note 1] Voting for the action: Mr. H.

Kataoka dissented, considering that, since there remained an excess supply capacity in capital stock and the labor market, monetary easing effects gained from the current yield curve were not enough for 2 percent inflation to be achieved around fiscal 2019. [Note 2] Mr. G. Kataoka opposed the description on the outlook for the CPI, considering that, although the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI was likely to increase for the time being reflecting developments in crude oil prices and foreign exchange rates, the possibility of the rate of change increasing toward 2 percent from 2018 onward was low at this point. (Reference) Meeting hours: Wednesday, September 20: 14:00-15:44 Thursday, September 21: 9:00-12:08 Policy Board members present:    Haruhiko Kuroda (Governor)    Kikuo Iwata (Deputy Governor)    Hiroshi Nakaso (Deputy Governor) Yutaka Harada Yukitoshi Funo Makoto Sakurai Takako Masai Hitoshi Suzuki Goushi Kataoka  (Others present) September 20 From the Ministry of Finance: Tetsuo Kabe, Deputy Vice Minister for Policy Planning and Co-ordination (14:00-15:44) From the Cabinet Office: Mamoru Maekawa, Vice-Minister for Policy Coordination (14:00-15:44)  September 21 From the Ministry of Finance: Minoru Kihara, State Minister of Finance (9:00-11:50, 11:59-12:08) From the Cabinet Office:  Takao Ochi, State Minister of Cabinet Office (9:00-11:50, 11:59-12:08)  Release Dates and Time: Statement on Monetary Policy -- Thursday, September 21 at 12:15 Release Schedule: Summary of Opinions -- Friday, September 29 at 8:50 Minutes -- Monday, November 6 at 8:50 "
20171031," 1 October 31, 2017 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following. [Note 1] (1) Yield curve control The Bank decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period. [Note 2] The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The long-term interest rate: The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. With regard to the amount of JGBs to be purchased, the Bank will conduct purchases at more or less the current pace -- an annual pace of increase in the amount outstanding of its JGB holdings of about 80 trillion yen -- aiming to achieve the target level of the long-term interest rate specified by the guideline. (2) Guidelines for asset purchases With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guidelines.  a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 6 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen, respectively. b) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen, respectively.   2                                                    [Note 1] With a view to reinforcing the inflation-overshooting commitment, Mr. G. Kataoka dissented from the decision, considering that, if there was a delay in the timing of achieving the price stability target due to domestic factors, the Bank should take additional easing measures and that it was necessary to include that in the text.

Kataoka.     Mr. G. Kataoka dissented, considering that, with a view to lowering the interest rates with longer maturities of the yield curve, it was appropriate for the Bank to purchase JGBs so that 15-year JGB yields would remain at less than 0.2 percent. (Reference) Meeting hours: Monday, October 30: 14:00-15:09 Tuesday, October 31: 9:00-11:58 Policy Board members present:    Haruhiko Kuroda (Governor)    Kikuo Iwata (Deputy Governor)    Hiroshi Nakaso (Deputy Governor) Yutaka Harada Yukitoshi Funo Makoto Sakurai Takako Masai Hitoshi Suzuki Goushi Kataoka (Others present) October 30 From the Ministry of Finance: Tetsuo Kabe, Deputy Vice Minister for Policy Planning and Co-ordination (14:00-15:09) From the Cabinet Office: Mamoru Maekawa, Vice-Minister for Policy Coordination (14:00-15:09)  October 31 From the Ministry of Finance: Minoru Kihara, State Minister of Finance (9:00-11:33, 11:42-11:58) From the Cabinet Office:  Takao Ochi, State Minister of Cabinet Office (9:00-11:33, 11:42-11:58)  Release Dates and Time: Statement on Monetary Policy -- Tuesday, October 31 at 12:05 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (The Banks View) -- Tuesday, October 31 at 12:05 Release Schedule: Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report, full text including The Background) -- Wednesday, November 1 at 14:00 Summary of Opinions -- Thursday, November 9 at 8:50 Minutes -- Tuesday, December 26 at 8:50 "
20171221," 1 December 21, 2017 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following. (1) Yield curve control The Bank decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period. [Note 1] The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The long-term interest rate: The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent.

Japan's economy is expanding moderately, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating. Overseas economies have continued to grow at a moderate pace on the whole. In this situation, exports have been on an increasing trend. On the domestic demand side,  2 business fixed investment has continued on an increasing trend with corporate profits and business sentiment improving. Private consumption has been increasing moderately, albeit with fluctuations, against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation. Housing investment has been more or less flat. Meanwhile, public investment has been more or less flat, remaining at a relatively high level. Reflecting these increases in demand both at home and abroad, industrial production has been on an increasing trend, and labor market conditions have continued to tighten steadily. Financial conditions are highly accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent. Inflation expectations have remained in a weakening phase. 3. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to continue its moderate expansion. Domestic demand is likely to follow an uptrend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained in both the corporate and household sectors, on the back of highly accommodative financial conditions and underpinnings through the government's past stimulus measures. Exports are expected to continue their moderate increasing trend on the back of the growth in overseas economies. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to continue on an uptrend and increase toward 2 percent, mainly on the back of an improvement in the output gap and a rise in medium- to long-term inflation expectations.

Kataoka dissented, considering that, taking account of risk factors such as the consumption tax hike and a possible economic downturn in the United States, it was desirable to achieve the price stability target in fiscal 2018, and that it was appropriate for the Bank to purchase JGBs so that yields on JGBs with maturities of 10 years and longer would be broadly lowered. [Note 2] Mr. G. Kataoka opposed the description, considering that the possibility of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI increasing toward 2 percent going forward was low at this point. [Note 3] With a view to reinforcing the inflation-overshooting commitment, Mr. G. Kataoka opposed the description, considering that, if there was a delay in the timing of achieving the price stability target due to domestic factors, the Bank should take additional easing measures and that it was necessary to include that in the text. (Reference) Meeting hours: Wednesday, December 20: 14:00-15:27 Thursday, December 21: 9:00-11:39 Policy Board members present:    Haruhiko Kuroda (Governor)    Kikuo Iwata (Deputy Governor)    Hiroshi Nakaso (Deputy Governor) Yutaka Harada Yukitoshi Funo Makoto Sakurai Takako Masai Hitoshi Suzuki Goushi Kataoka  (Others present) December 20 From the Ministry of Finance: Tetsuo Kabe, Deputy Vice Minister for Policy Planning and Co-ordination (14:00-15:27) From the Cabinet Office: Mamoru Maekawa, Vice-Minister for Policy Coordination (14:00-15:27)  December 21 From the Ministry of Finance: Minoru Kihara, State Minister of Finance (9:00-11:23, 11:31-11:39) From the Cabinet Office:  Takao Ochi, State Minister of Cabinet Office (9:00-11:23, 11:31-11:39)  Release Dates and Time: Statement on Monetary Policy -- Thursday, December 21 at 11:46 Release Schedule: Summary of Opinions -- Thursday, December 28 at 8:50 Minutes -- Friday, January 26 at 8:50 "

Domestic demand is likely to follow an uptrend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained in both the corporate and household sectors, mainly against the background of highly accommodative financial conditions and the underpinnings through government spending. Exports are expected to continue their moderate increasing trend on the back of the firm growth in overseas economies. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to continue on an uptrend and increase toward 2 percent, mainly on the back of an improvement in the output gap and a rise in medium- to long-term inflation expectations. [Note 2] 4. Risks to the outlook include the following: the U.S. economic policies and their impact on global financial markets; developments in emerging and commodity-exporting economies; negotiations on the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (EU) and their effects; and geopolitical risks. 5. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will make policy adjustments as appropriate, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, with a view to maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target.

Kataoka dissented, considering that, taking account of risk factors through fiscal 2020 such as the consumption tax hike and a possible economic downturn in the United States, it was desirable to further strengthen monetary easing, and that it was appropriate for the Bank to purchase JGBs so that yields on JGBs with maturities of 10 years and longer would broadly be lowered further. [Note 2] Mr. G. Kataoka dissented, considering that the possibility of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI increasing toward 2 percent going forward was low at this point. [Note 3] With a view to reinforcing the inflation-overshooting commitment and achieving the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time, Mr. G. Kataoka dissented, considering that, if the Bank revised downward its assessment of medium- to long-term inflation expectations, it should take additional easing measures, and that it was necessary to include that in the text. (Reference) Meeting hours: Thursday, June 14: 14:00-15:32 Friday, June 15: 9:00-11:34 Policy Board members present:    Haruhiko Kuroda (Governor)    Masayoshi Amamiya (Deputy Governor)    Masazumi Wakatabe (Deputy Governor) Yutaka Harada Yukitoshi Funo Makoto Sakurai Takako Masai Hitoshi Suzuki Goushi Kataoka (Others present) June 14 From the Ministry of Finance: Tetsuo Kabe, Deputy Vice Minister for Policy Planning and Co-ordination (14:00-15:32) From the Cabinet Office: Mamoru Maekawa, Vice-Minister for Policy Coordination (14:00-15:32)  June 15 From the Ministry of Finance: Minoru Kihara, State Minister of Finance (9:00-11:19, 11:27-11:34) From the Cabinet Office:  Mamoru Maekawa, Vice-Minister for Policy Coordination (9:00-11:19, 11:27-11:34)  Release Dates and Time: Statement on Monetary Policy -- Friday, June 15 at 11:41 Release Schedule: Summary of Opinions -- Monday, June 25 at 8:50 Minutes -- Friday, August 3 at 8:50 "
20180731," 1 July 31, 2018 Bank of Japan  Strengthening the Framework for Continuous Powerful Monetary Easing  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) held today, with a view to persistently continuing with powerful monetary easing, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided to strengthen its commitment to achieving the price stability target by introducing forward guidance for policy rates, and to enhance the sustainability of ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control."" (1) Forward guidance for policy rates [Note 1] The Bank intends to maintain the current extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates for an extended period of time, taking into account uncertainties regarding economic activity and prices including the effects of the consumption tax hike scheduled to take place in October 2019. (2) Yield curve control The Bank decided, by a 7-2 majority vote, to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period. [Note 2] The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The long-term interest rate: The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. While doing so, the yields may move upward and downward to some extent mainly depending on developments in economic activity and prices.1 With regard to the amount of JGBs to be purchased, the Bank will conduct purchases in a flexible manner so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen.                                                    1 In case of a rapid increase in the yields, the Bank will purchase JGBs promptly and appropriately.  2 (3) Guidelines for asset purchases With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guidelines.  a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 6 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen, respectively. With a view to lowering risk premia of asset prices in an appropriate manner, the Bank may increase or decrease the amount of purchases depending on market conditions.2 b) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen, respectively. 2. In addition, the Bank decided to make the following adjustments in accordance with the measures described above. a) Change in the size of the Policy-Rate Balance The Bank, under the condition that yield curve control can be conducted appropriately, will reduce the size of the Policy-Rate Balance in financial institutions' current account balances at the Bank -- to which a negative interest rate is applied -- from the current level of about 10 trillion yen on average. This Balance is calculated assuming that arbitrage transactions take place in full among financial institutions.  b) Change in the amount of each ETF to be purchased The Bank will revise the purchase amount of each ETF and increase that of ETFs which track the Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX). 3. Japan's economy is expanding moderately, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating, and labor market conditions have continued to tighten steadily. Meanwhile, prices have continued to show relatively weak developments compared to the economic and employment conditions. As shown in the July 2018 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report) released today, this is attributable to a combination of factors such as firms' cautious wage- and price-setting stance and households' continuous cautiousness toward price rises, and it is likely to take more time than expected to achieve the price stability target of 2                                                    2 The Bank will continue purchasing ETFs composed of stocks issued by firms that are proactively investing in physical and human capital at an annual pace of about 300 billion yen, as decided at the MPM held in December 2015.  3 percent. However, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent with the output gap remaining positive.  4. Based on the above recognition, the Bank judged it appropriate to introduce forward guidance for policy rates and to enhance the sustainability of ""QQE with Yield Curve Control"" by conducting market operations as well as asset purchases in a more flexible manner, thereby maintaining the output gap as long as possible within positive territory. The Bank recognizes that this will lead to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time, while securing stability in economic and financial conditions.  5. The Bank will continue with ""QQE with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will examine the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy and make policy adjustments as appropriate, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, with a view to maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target.                                                     [Note 1] Mr. Y. Harada dissented, considering that it was appropriate to introduce forward guidance that would further clarify its relationship with the price stability target. With a view to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time, Mr. G. Kataoka dissented, considering that it was appropriate for the Bank to make a commitment to taking additional easing measures if it revised downward its assessment of medium- to long-term inflation expectations, rather than to make the commitment to maintaining the levels of short- and long-term interest rates. [Note 2] Voting for the action: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. M. Amamiya, Mr. M. Wakatabe, Mr. Y. Funo,         Mr. M. Sakurai, Ms. T. Masai, and Mr. H. Suzuki. Voting against the action: Mr. Y. Harada and   Mr. G. Kataoka. Mr. Y. Harada dissented, considering that allowing the long-term yields to move upward and downward to some extent was too ambiguous as the guideline for market operations decided by the Policy Board. Mr. G. Kataoka dissented, considering that (1) taking account of the current sluggishness in prices and risk factors going forward, it was desirable to strengthen monetary easing so that yields on JGBs with maturities of 10 years and longer would broadly be lowered further, and (2) controlling the long-term yields in a flexible manner would make their target level of around zero percent unclear. (Reference) Meeting hours: Monday, July 30: 14:00-15:30 Tuesday, July 31: 9:00-12:56 Policy Board members present:    Haruhiko Kuroda (Governor)    Masayoshi Amamiya (Deputy Governor)    Masazumi Wakatabe (Deputy Governor) Yutaka Harada Yukitoshi Funo Makoto Sakurai Takako Masai Hitoshi Suzuki Goushi Kataoka (Others present) July 30 From the Ministry of Finance: Eiji Chatani, Deputy Vice Minister for Policy Planning and Co-ordination (14:00-15:30) From the Cabinet Office: Akihiro Nakamura, Vice-Minister for Policy Coordination (14:00-15:30)  July 31 From the Ministry of Finance: Minoru Kihara, State Minister of Finance (9:00-12:25, 12:33-12:56) From the Cabinet Office:  Takao Ochi, State Minister of Cabinet Office (9:00-12:25, 12:33-12:56)  Release Dates and Time: Strengthening the Framework for Continuous Powerful Monetary Easing -- Tuesday, July 31 at 13:03 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (The Banks View) -- Tuesday, July 31 at 13:03 Release Schedule: Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report, full text including The Background) -- Wednesday, August 1 at 14:00 Summary of Opinions -- Wednesday, August 8 at 8:50 Minutes -- Tuesday, September 25 at 8:50 "

Japan's economy is expanding moderately, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating. Overseas economies have continued to grow firmly on the whole. In this situation, exports have been on an increasing trend. On the domestic demand side, business fixed investment has continued on an increasing trend with corporate profits and business sentiment maintaining their improving trend. Private consumption has been increasing moderately, albeit with fluctuations, against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation. Meanwhile, housing investment has been more or less flat. Public investment also has been more or less flat, remaining at a relatively high level. Reflecting these increases in demand both at home and abroad, industrial production has been on an increasing trend, and labor market conditions have continued to tighten steadily. Financial conditions are highly accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent.

Kataoka dissented, considering that further coordination of fiscal and monetary policy was important, and that it was necessary for the Bank to make a commitment to taking additional easing measures if it revised downward its assessment of medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Reference Meeting hours: Wednesday, December 19: 14:00-15:23 Thursday, December 20: 9:00-11:45 Policy Board members present:    Haruhiko Kuroda, Chairman (Governor)    Masayoshi Amamiya (Deputy Governor)    Masazumi Wakatabe (Deputy Governor) Yutaka Harada Yukitoshi Funo Makoto Sakurai Takako Masai Hitoshi Suzuki Goushi Kataoka [Others present] December 19 From the Ministry of Finance: Eiji Chatani, Deputy Vice-Minister for Policy Planning and Coordination (14:00-15:23) From the Cabinet Office: Akihiro Nakamura, Vice-Minister for Policy Coordination (14:00-15:23) December 20 From the Ministry of Finance: Kenichiro Ueno, State Minister of Finance (9:00-11:31, 11:39-11:45) From the Cabinet Office: Ryosei Tanaka, State Minister of Cabinet Office (9:00-11:31, 11:39-11:45) Release dates and times: Statement on Monetary Policy -- Thursday, December 20, 2018 at 11:52 Summary of Opinions -- Friday, December 28, 2018 at 8:50 Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting -- Monday, January 28, 2019 at 8:50 "
20190123," 1 January 23, 2019 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following. (1) Yield curve control The Bank decided, by a 7-2 majority vote, to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period. [Note 1] The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The long-term interest rate: The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. While doing so, the yields may move upward and downward to some extent mainly depending on developments in economic activity and prices.1 With regard to the amount of JGBs to be purchased, the Bank will conduct purchases in a flexible manner so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen. (2) Guidelines for asset purchases With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guidelines. a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 6 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen, respectively. With a view to lowering risk premia of asset prices in an appropriate manner, the Bank may increase or decrease the amount of purchases depending on market conditions.                                                    1 In case of a rapid increase in the yields, the Bank will purchase JGBs promptly and appropriately.  2 b) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen, respectively. 2. The Policy Board decided, by a unanimous vote, to extend by one year the deadlines for new applications for such measures as the Fund-Provisioning Measure to Stimulate Bank Lending, the Fund-Provisioning Measure to Support Strengthening the Foundations for Economic Growth, and the Funds-Supplying Operation to Support Financial Institutions in Disaster Areas affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake and by the Kumamoto Earthquake. 3. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. As for policy rates, the Bank intends to maintain the current extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates for an extended period of time, taking into account uncertainties regarding economic activity and prices including the effects of the consumption tax hike scheduled to take place in October 2019. It will examine the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy and make policy adjustments as appropriate, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, with a view to maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target.

Harada dissented, considering that allowing the long-term yields to move upward and downward to some extent was too ambiguous as the guideline for market operations decided by the Policy Board. Mr. G. Kataoka dissented, considering that, with heightening uncertainties regarding developments in economic activity and prices going forward, it was desirable to strengthen monetary easing so that yields on JGBs with maturities of 10 years and longer would broadly be lowered further. [Note 2] Mr. Y. Harada dissented, considering that, as for policy rates, it was appropriate to introduce forward guidance that would further clarify its relationship with the price stability target. In order to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time, Mr. G.

Japan's economy is expanding moderately, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating, although exports and production have been affected by the slowdown in overseas economies. Overseas economies have been growing moderately on the whole, although slowdowns have been observed. In this situation, exports have shown some weakness recently. On the domestic demand side, business fixed investment has continued on an increasing trend, with corporate profits and business sentiment staying at favorable levels on the whole. Private consumption has been increasing moderately, albeit with fluctuations, against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation. Meanwhile, housing investment has been more or less flat. Public investment also has been more or less flat, remaining at a relatively high level. Reflecting these developments in demand both at home and abroad, industrial production has been on a moderate increasing trend, although it has shown some weakness recently. Labor market conditions have continued to tighten steadily. Financial conditions are highly accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is in the range of 0.5-1.0 percent. Inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged. 3. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to continue its moderate expansion, despite being affected by the slowdown in overseas economies for the time being. Domestic demand is likely to follow an uptrend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained in both the corporate and household sectors, mainly against the background of highly accommodative financial conditions and the underpinnings through government spending. Although exports are projected to show some weakness for the time being, they are expected to be on a moderate increasing trend on the back of overseas economies growing moderately on the whole. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent, mainly on the back of the output gap remaining positive and medium- to long-term inflation expectations rising. [Note 2] 4. Risks to the outlook include the following: the U.S. macroeconomic policies and their impact on global financial markets; the consequences of protectionist moves and their effects; developments in emerging and commodity-exporting economies including the effects of the two aforementioned factors; negotiations on the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (EU) and their effects; and geopolitical risks.  3 5. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.

20190425," 1 April 25, 2019 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, with a view to making clearer its policy stance to persistently continue with powerful monetary easing, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following. (1) Clarification of forward guidance for policy rates [Note 1] The Bank intends to maintain the current extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates for an extended period of time, at least through around spring 2020, taking into account uncertainties regarding economic activity and prices including developments in overseas economies and the effects of the scheduled consumption tax hike. (2) Implementation of measures contributing to the continuation of powerful monetary easing The Bank will implement the measures shown in the Attachment, including the expansion of eligible collateral for the Bank's provision of credit. 2. As for the guidelines for market operations and asset purchases, the Bank decided upon the following. (1) Yield curve control The Bank decided, by a 7-2 majority vote, to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period. [Note 2] The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank.

(2) Guidelines for asset purchases With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guidelines. a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 6 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen, respectively.

Japan's economy is likely to continue on a moderate expanding trend, despite being affected by the slowdown in overseas economies for the time being. Although the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI) has continued to show relatively weak developments compared to the economic expansion and the labor market tightening, it is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent, mainly due to the output gap remaining positive. However, there are high uncertainties regarding the outlook for economic activity and prices including developments in overseas economies. In addition, it is likely to still take time to achieve the price stability target. 4. Based on the above recognition, the Bank decided to make clearer its stance to persistently continue with powerful monetary easing while examining uncertainties regarding economic activity and prices including the effects of the scheduled consumption tax hike and developments in overseas economies. Also, the Bank judged it appropriate to take such measures as the expansion of eligible collateral for the Bank's provision of credit, thereby contributing to smooth implementation of fund-provisioning and asset purchases as well as to securing market functioning. By continuing with powerful monetary easing and thereby maintaining the output gap within positive territory, the Bank will aim to achieve the price stability target at the earliest possible time, while securing stability in economic and financial conditions.  3 5. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.

[Note 1] Mr. Y. Harada dissented, considering that, in revising forward guidance for policy rates, it was appropriate to further clarify its relationship with the price stability target. In order to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time, Mr. G. Kataoka dissented, considering that further coordination of fiscal and monetary policy was important, and that it was necessary for the Bank to make a commitment to taking additional easing measures if it revised downward its assessment of medium- to long-term inflation expectations.

Expanding eligible collateral for the Bank's provision of credit (1) The Bank will relax the eligibility standards concerning creditworthiness regarding debt of companies based on the following principal policy. a) With regard to debt of companies that have obtained an external credit rating, the companies should be rated BBB or higher by an eligible rating agency. b) With regard to debt of companies that have not obtained an external credit rating, the companies should be classified as ""normal"" borrowers in the self-assessment by financial institutions. (2) With respect to loans on deeds to municipal governments, the Bank will not require any procedures such as auction as the method of determining lending conditions. Regarding privately-placed municipal bonds, the Bank will not impose spread requirements on the coupon rates and issue prices in terms of differences from those of publicly-offered municipal bonds. (3) The Bank will accept collateral such as loans on deeds to the government that financial institutions have acquired in the secondary market as eligible collateral. 2. Improving and promoting the use of the Fund-Provisioning Measure to Support Strengthening the Foundations for Economic Growth (1) Regarding the Fund-Provisioning Measure to Support Strengthening the Foundations for Economic Growth, financial institutions will be able to receive the yen fund-provisioning within the limit set for each financial institution based on the amount of fund-provisioning in the past. (2) Regarding the Fund-Provisioning Measure to Support Strengthening the Foundations for Economic Growth and the Fund-Provisioning Measure to Stimulate Bank Lending, the deadline for new loan disbursements will be extended to June 30, 2021.                                                    2 The above measures 1. through 3. will be implemented soon after necessary preparations are completed.

Downside risks concerning overseas economies are likely to be  3 significant, and it also is necessary to pay close attention to their impact on firms' and households' sentiment in Japan. 5. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.

Kataoka dissented, considering that further coordination of fiscal and monetary policy was important, and that it was necessary for the Bank to make a commitment to taking additional easing measures if it revised downward its assessment of medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Reference Meeting hours: Wednesday, June 19: 14:00-16:05 Thursday, June 20: 9:00-11:38 Policy Board members present:    Haruhiko Kuroda, Chairman (Governor)    Masayoshi Amamiya (Deputy Governor)    Masazumi Wakatabe (Deputy Governor) Yutaka Harada Yukitoshi Funo Makoto Sakurai Takako Masai Hitoshi Suzuki Goushi Kataoka [Others present] June 19 From the Ministry of Finance: Eiji Chatani, Deputy Vice-Minister for Policy Planning and Coordination (14:00-16:05) From the Cabinet Office: Akihiro Nakamura, Vice-Minister for Policy Coordination (14:00-16:05) June 20 From the Ministry of Finance: Kenichiro Ueno, State Minister of Finance (9:00-11:23, 11:31-11:38) From the Cabinet Office: Akihiro Nakamura, Vice-Minister for Policy Coordination (9:00-11:23, 11:31-11:38)  Release dates and times: Statement on Monetary Policy -- Thursday, June 20 at 11:45 Summary of Opinions -- Friday, June 28 at 8:50 Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting -- Friday, August 2 at 8:50 "
20190730,"1 July 30, 2019 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following. (1) Yield curve control The Bank decided, by a 7-2 majority vote, to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period. [Note 1] The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The long-term interest rate: The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. While doing so, the yields may move upward and downward to some extent mainly depending on developments in economic activity and prices.1 With regard to the amount of JGBs to be purchased, the Bank will conduct purchases in a flexible manner so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen. (2) Guidelines for asset purchases With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guidelines. a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 6 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen, respectively. With a view to lowering risk premia of asset prices in an appropriate manner, the Bank may increase or decrease the amount of purchases depending on market conditions.                                                    1 In case of a rapid increase in the yields, the Bank will purchase JGBs promptly and appropriately. 2 b) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen, respectively. 2. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. As for policy rates, the Bank intends to maintain the current extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates for an extended period of time, at least through around spring 2020, taking into account uncertainties regarding economic activity and prices including developments in overseas economies and the effects of the scheduled consumption tax hike. It will examine the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy and make policy adjustments as appropriate, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, with a view to maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target. In particular, in a situation where downside risks to economic activity and prices, mainly regarding developments in overseas economies, are significant, the Bank will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if there is a greater possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost.

20190919,"1 September 19, 2019 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following. (1) Yield curve control The Bank decided, by a 7-2 majority vote, to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period. [Note 1] The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The long-term interest rate: The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent.

Japan's economy has been on a moderate expanding trend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating, although exports, production, and business sentiment have been affected by the slowdown in overseas economies. Overseas economies have been growing moderately on the whole, although slowdowns have continued to be observed. In this situation, exports have shown some weakness. On the other hand, with corporate profits staying at high levels on the whole, business fixed investment has continued on an increasing trend. Private consumption has been increasing moderately, albeit with fluctuations, against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation. Housing investment and public investment have been more or less flat. Although exports have shown some weakness, industrial production also has been more or less flat, reflecting the increase in domestic demand, and labor market conditions have remained tight. Meanwhile, financial conditions are highly accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is at around 0.5 percent. Inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged. 3. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to continue on a moderate expanding trend, despite being affected by the slowdown in overseas economies for the time being. Domestic demand is expected to follow an uptrend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained in both the corporate and household sectors, mainly against the background of highly accommodative financial conditions and the underpinnings through government spending, despite being affected by such factors as the scheduled consumption tax hike. Although exports are projected to show some weakness for the time being, they are expected to be on a moderate increasing trend on the back of overseas economies growing moderately on the whole. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent, mainly on the back of the output gap remaining positive and medium- to long-term inflation expectations rising. [Note 2] 4. Risks to the outlook include the following: the U.S. macroeconomic policies and their impact on global financial markets; the consequences of protectionist moves and their effects; developments in emerging and commodity-exporting economies such as China, including the effects of the two aforementioned factors; developments in global adjustments in IT-related goods; negotiations on the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (EU) and their effects; and geopolitical risks. Downside risks concerning overseas economies seem to be 3 increasing, and it also is necessary to pay close attention to their impact on firms' and households' sentiment in Japan. 5. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. As for policy rates, the Bank intends to maintain the current extremely low levels of short- and long-term interest rates for an extended period of time, at least through around spring 2020, taking into account uncertainties regarding economic activity and prices including developments in overseas economies and the effects of the scheduled consumption tax hike. It will examine the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy and make policy adjustments as appropriate, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, with a view to maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target. In particular, in a situation where downside risks to economic activity and prices, mainly regarding developments in overseas economies, are significant, the Bank will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if there is a greater possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost. [Note 3] 6. Given that, recently, slowdowns in overseas economies have continued to be observed and their downside risks seem to be increasing, the Bank judges that it is becoming necessary to pay closer attention to the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost. Taking this situation into account, the Bank will reexamine economic and price developments at the next MPM, when it updates the outlook for economic activity and prices.

20191031,"1 October 31, 2019 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan judged that, although there had been no further increase in the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target would be lost, it was necessary to continue to pay close attention to the possibility.1 With a view to clarifying this recognition, it decided on a new forward guidance for the policy rates as follows. [Note 1] As for the policy rates, the Bank expects short- and long-term interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels as long as it is necessary to pay close attention to the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost. 2. As for the guidelines for market operations and asset purchases, the Bank decided upon the following. (1) Yield curve control The Bank decided, by a 7-2 majority vote, to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period. [Note 2] The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The long-term interest rate: The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. While doing so, the yields may move upward and downward to some extent mainly depending on developments in economic activity and prices.2 With regard to the amount of JGBs to be purchased, the Bank will conduct purchases in a flexible manner so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen.                                                    1 At the MPM held today, the Bank reexamined economic and price developments as presented in the policy statement of the previous MPM and assessed the momentum toward achieving the price stability target. The results are shown in the Attachment. 2 In case of a rapid increase in the yields, the Bank will purchase JGBs promptly and appropriately. 2 (2) Guidelines for asset purchases With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guidelines. a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 6 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen, respectively. With a view to lowering risk premia of asset prices in an appropriate manner, the Bank may increase or decrease the amount of purchases depending on market conditions. b) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen, respectively. 3.

[Note 1] In order to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent at the earliest possible time, Mr. G. Kataoka dissented, considering that further coordination of fiscal and monetary policy was necessary, and that it was appropriate for the Bank to revise the forward guidance for the policy rates to make it a powerful one that specifically relates to the price stability target. [Note 2] Voting for the action: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. M. Amamiya, Mr. M. Wakatabe, Mr. Y. Funo,         Mr. M. Sakurai, Ms. T. Masai, and Mr. H. Suzuki. Voting against the action: Mr. Y.

Mr. G. Kataoka dissented, considering that it was desirable to strengthen monetary easing by lowering the short-term policy interest rate. 3 Attachment  Assessment of the Momentum toward Achieving the Price Stability Target [Note 3]  The Bank of Japan judged, at the previous Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM), that it was becoming necessary to pay closer attention to the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target would be lost, given that, recently, slowdowns in overseas economies had continued to be observed and their downside risks seemed to be increasing. Taking this situation into account, at this MPM, the Bank examined such factors as the output gap and medium- to long-term inflation expectations, which are the main elements of the assessment of the momentum toward achieving the price stability target. On this basis, the Bank judged that, although there had been no further increase in the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target would be lost, it was necessary to continue to pay close attention to the possibility. I. Output Gap The output gap is likely to narrow temporarily within positive territory. However, throughout the projection period, it is expected to remain at around the current level on average with the economy continuing on an expanding trend. As for overseas economies, the timing of a pick-up in the growth pace is likely to be delayed for longer than expected, mainly due to the intensified and prolonged U.S.-China trade friction as well as slowdowns continuing in emerging and commodity-exporting economies, such as China. Under these circumstances, Japan's economy is expected to grow temporarily at a somewhat slower pace than its potential, mainly reflecting the effects of continuing relatively weak developments in exports and of the consumption tax hike, and the output gap is likely to narrow temporarily within positive territory. However, throughout the projection period -- that is, through fiscal 2021 -- business fixed investment -- mainly investment related to urban redevelopment projects, labor-saving investment, and research and development (R&D) investment -- is likely to continue increasing moderately, although the pace of increase is expected to decelerate temporarily, mainly for manufacturing, due to the effects of the slowdown in overseas economies. Private consumption is expected to follow a moderate increasing trend, mainly because the employment and income situation is likely to continue improving, with the effects of the consumption tax hike remaining 4 small. Thus, domestic demand is likely to follow an uptrend, as the impact of the slowdown in overseas economies is expected to be limited. With regard to overseas economies, the growth rates are expected to rise, partly backed by the materialization of the effects of macroeconomic policies in each country as well as the progress in global adjustments in IT-related goods. In this situation, Japan's economy is likely to continue on an expanding trend throughout the projection period. On average, it is expected that the economy will continue growing at about the same pace as its potential, and the positive output gap will remain at around the current level. II. Medium- to Long-Term Inflation Expectations Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged on the whole, although they have shown somewhat different developments depending on indicators. As for the outlook, such expectations are likely to follow an increasing trend, with the output gap remaining positive. Medium- to long-term inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged on the whole, although each indicator has shown somewhat different developments, in that some have indicated relatively weak developments while others have shown an increase. In addition, there have been signs that households' tolerance of price rises will increase and firms' stance will shift toward further raising prices, although both have remained cautious. Regarding the outlook, it is expected that households' tolerance of price rises will increase steadily and firms' stance gradually will shift toward further raising prices as the employment and income situation is likely to continue improving with the economy maintaining an expanding trend and the output gap remaining positive. If households' and firms' stances toward prices become more active, in terms of the adaptive component, medium- to long-term inflation expectations are likely to be pushed up through a rise in the observed inflation rate. In addition, in terms of the forward-looking component, the Bank will pursue monetary easing through its strong commitment to achieving the price stability target, which will be effective in pushing up medium- to long-term inflation expectations. Under these circumstances, medium- to long-term inflation expectations are likely to follow an increasing trend and gradually converge to 2 percent. 5 III. Factors such as Developments in Crude Oil Prices and Global Financial Markets Looking at developments in crude oil prices and global financial markets, which affect overall prices including import prices, crude oil prices have been more or less flat -- albeit with fluctuations -- since around this summer, although they have been lower compared to the level seen around spring. With regard to global financial markets, investors' risk aversion had continued to be observed, mainly against the background of the U.S.-China trade friction and concern over the slowdown in the global economy, but the markets recently have been calm compared to a while ago. IV. Points to Take into Account With regard to price developments, uncertainties over both the output gap and medium- to long-term inflation expectations remain significant. In particular, close attention should be paid to the possibility that, in a situation where downside risks concerning overseas economies seem to be increasing, if they materialize, such as in the form of a further delay in the timing of a pick-up or a further deceleration in the growth pace of overseas economies, prices will be affected to some extent, mainly through the output gap. In addition, it is necessary to closely monitor future developments in crude oil prices and global financial markets because they also could affect prices.                                                     [Note 3] Voting for the action: Mr. H. Kuroda, Mr. M. Amamiya, Mr. M. Wakatabe, Mr. Y. Harada, Mr. Y. Funo, Mr. M. Sakurai, Ms. T. Masai, and Mr. H. Suzuki. Voting against the action: Mr. G. Kataoka.     Mr. G. Kataoka dissented, considering that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target had already been lost, given developments in the observed inflation rate, the output gap, and inflation expectations. Reference Meeting hours: Wednesday, October 30: 14:00-15:52 Thursday, October 31: 9:00-12:25 Policy Board members present:    Haruhiko Kuroda, Chairman (Governor)    Masayoshi Amamiya (Deputy Governor)    Masazumi Wakatabe (Deputy Governor) Yutaka Harada Yukitoshi Funo Makoto Sakurai Takako Masai Hitoshi Suzuki Goushi Kataoka [Others present] October 30 From the Ministry of Finance: Masato Kanda, Deputy Vice-Minister for Policy Planning and Coordination (14:00-15:52) From the Cabinet Office: Hiroshi Tawa, Vice-Minister for Policy Coordination (14:00-15:52) October 31 From the Ministry of Finance: Kiyohiko Toyama, State Minister of Finance (9:00-11:58, 12:07-12:25) From the Cabinet Office: Ichiro Miyashita, State Minister of Cabinet Office (9:00-11:58, 12:07-12:25) Release dates and times: Statement on Monetary Policy -- Thursday, October 31 at 12:32 Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices (Outlook Report) The Bank's View -- Thursday, October 31 at 12:32 Full text -- Friday, November 1 at 14:00 Summary of Opinions -- Monday, November 11 at 8:50 Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting -- Tuesday, December 24 at 8:50 "
20191219,"1 December 19, 2019 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following. (1) Yield curve control The Bank decided, by a 7-2 majority vote, to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period. [Note 1] The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The long-term interest rate: The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. While doing so, the yields may move upward and downward to some extent mainly depending on developments in economic activity and prices.1 With regard to the amount of JGBs to be purchased, the Bank will conduct purchases in a flexible manner so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen. (2) Guidelines for asset purchases With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guidelines. a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 6 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen, respectively. With a view to lowering risk premia of asset prices in an appropriate manner, the Bank may increase or decrease the amount of purchases depending on market conditions.                                                    1 In case of a rapid increase in the yields, the Bank will purchase JGBs promptly and appropriately. 2 b) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen, respectively. 2. Japan's economy has been on a moderate expanding trend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending operating, although exports, production, and business sentiment have shown some weakness, mainly affected by the slowdown in overseas economies and natural disasters. Overseas economies have been growing moderately on the whole, although slowdowns have continued to be observed. In this situation, exports have continued to show some weakness, and industrial production has declined recently, due partly to the effects of natural disasters. On the other hand, with corporate profits staying at high levels on the whole, business fixed investment has continued on an increasing trend. Private consumption has been increasing moderately, albeit with fluctuations due to such effects as of the consumption tax hike, against the background of steady improvement in the employment and income situation. Housing investment has been more or less flat, and public investment has increased moderately. Meanwhile, labor market conditions have remained tight. Financial conditions are highly accommodative. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is at around 0.5 percent. Inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged. 3. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to continue on a moderate expanding trend, as the impact of the slowdown in overseas economies on domestic demand is expected to be limited, although the economy is likely to continue to be affected by the slowdown for the time being. Domestic demand is expected to follow an uptrend, with a virtuous cycle from income to spending being maintained in both the corporate and household sectors, mainly against the background of highly accommodative financial conditions and active government spending, despite being affected by such factors as the consumption tax hike. Although exports are projected to continue showing some weakness for the time being, they are expected to be on a moderate increasing trend on the back of overseas economies growing moderately on the whole. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI is likely to increase gradually toward 2 percent, mainly on the back of the output gap remaining positive and medium- to long-term inflation expectations rising, despite such effects as of the decline in crude oil prices for the time being. [Note 2] 4. Risks to the outlook include the following: the consequences of protectionist moves and their effects; developments in emerging and commodity-exporting economies such as China; developments in global adjustments in IT-related goods; developments in the United 3 Kingdom's exit from the European Union (EU) and their effects; geopolitical risks; and developments in global financial markets under these circumstances. Downside risks concerning overseas economies seem to remain significant, and it also is necessary to pay close attention to their impact on firms' and households' sentiment in Japan. 5. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. As for the policy rates, the Bank expects short- and long-term interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels as long as it is necessary to pay close attention to the possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost. It will examine the risks considered most relevant to the conduct of monetary policy and make policy adjustments as appropriate, taking account of developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions, with a view to maintaining the momentum toward achieving the price stability target. In particular, in a situation where downside risks to economic activity and prices, mainly regarding developments in overseas economies, are significant, the Bank will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if there is a greater possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost.

Mr. G. Kataoka dissented, considering that it was desirable to strengthen monetary easing by lowering the short-term policy interest rate. [Note 2] Mr. G. Kataoka dissented, considering that the possibility of the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI increasing toward 2 percent going forward was low at this point.

Kataoka dissented, considering that further coordination of fiscal and monetary policy was necessary, and that it was appropriate for the Bank to revise the forward guidance for the policy rates to make it a powerful one that specifically relates to the price stability target. Reference Meeting hours: Wednesday, December 18: 14:00-16:15 Thursday, December 19: 9:00-11:38 Policy Board members present:    Haruhiko Kuroda, Chairman (Governor)    Masayoshi Amamiya (Deputy Governor)    Masazumi Wakatabe (Deputy Governor) Yutaka Harada Yukitoshi Funo Makoto Sakurai Takako Masai Hitoshi Suzuki Goushi Kataoka [Others present] December 18 From the Ministry of Finance: Masato Kanda, Deputy Vice-Minister for Policy Planning and Coordination (14:00-16:15) From the Cabinet Office: Hiroshi Tawa, Vice-Minister for Policy Coordination (14:00-16:15) December 19 From the Ministry of Finance: Kiyohiko Toyama, State Minister of Finance (9:00-11:22, 11:29-11:38) From the Cabinet Office: Ichiro Miyashita, State Minister of Cabinet Office (9:00-11:22, 11:29-11:38)  Release dates and times: Statement on Monetary Policy -- Thursday, December 19, 2019 at 11:45 Summary of Opinions -- Friday, December 27, 2019 at 8:50 Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting -- Friday, January 24, 2020 at 8:50 "
20200121,"1 January 21, 2020 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following. (1) Yield curve control The Bank decided, by a 7-2 majority vote, to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period. [Note 1] The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The long-term interest rate: The Bank will purchase Japanese government bonds (JGBs) so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. While doing so, the yields may move upward and downward to some extent mainly depending on developments in economic activity and prices.1 With regard to the amount of JGBs to be purchased, the Bank will conduct purchases in a flexible manner so that their amount outstanding will increase at an annual pace of about 80 trillion yen. (2) Guidelines for asset purchases With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guidelines. a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 6 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen, respectively. With a view to lowering risk premia of asset prices in an appropriate manner, the Bank may increase or decrease the amount of purchases depending on market conditions.                                                    1 In case of a rapid increase in the yields, the Bank will purchase JGBs promptly and appropriately. 2 b) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2.2 trillion yen and about 3.2 trillion yen, respectively. 2. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner.

20200427," 1 April 27, 2020 Bank of Japan  Enhancement of Monetary Easing  1. Japan's economy has been in an increasingly severe situation due to the impact of the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) at home and abroad. Although policy responses taken by the government and the Bank of Japan have been exerting some positive effects, financial conditions have been less accommodative in terms of corporate financing, as seen in deterioration in firms' financial positions. 2. Given these developments, the Bank judged it appropriate to further enhance monetary easing through (1) an increase in purchases of CP and corporate bonds, (2) strengthening of the Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), and (3) further active purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and treasury discount bills (T-Bills). The Bank will take these measures with a view to doing its utmost to ensure smooth financing, such as of financial institutions and firms, and maintaining stability in financial markets. 3. To this end, at the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) held today, the Policy Board of the Bank decided upon the following. (1) Increase in purchases of CP and corporate bonds The Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, to significantly increase the maximum amount of additional purchases of CP and corporate bonds and conduct purchases with the upper limit of the amount outstanding of about 20 trillion yen in total.1 In addition, the maximum amounts outstanding of a single issuer's CP and corporate bonds to be purchased will be raised substantially, and the maximum remaining maturity of corporate bonds to be purchased will be extended to 5 years (see Attachment).                                                    1 The maximum amounts of additional purchases of CP and corporate bonds will be increased from 1 trillion yen to 7.5 trillion yen for each asset. Other than the additional purchases, the existing amounts outstanding of CP and corporate bonds will be maintained at about 2 trillion yen and about 3 trillion yen, respectively. The additional purchases will continue until the end of September 2020.  2 (2) Strengthening of the Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) With regard to the Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Corporate Financing regarding the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), which was introduced and became effective in March, the Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, to (1) expand the range of eligible collateral to private debt in general, including household debt (from about 8 trillion yen to about 23 trillion yen as of end-March 2020), (2) increase the number of eligible counterparties (to mainly include member financial institutions of central organizations of financial cooperatives), and (3) apply a positive interest rate of 0.1 percent to the outstanding balances of current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank that correspond to the amounts outstanding of loans provided through this operation.2 The Bank decided to strengthen this operation with a view to firmly supporting financial institutions to further fulfill the functioning of financial intermediation for a wide range of private sectors, mainly in terms of firms. This operation has been renamed to the Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19). In addition, with the aim of further supporting financing mainly of small and medium-sized firms, the chairman instructed the staff to swiftly consider a new measure to provide funds to financial institutions, taking account, for example, of the government's programs to support financing such as those in its emergency economic measures, and report back at a later MPM (see Attachment for the outline of the measure). (3) Further active purchases of JGBs and T-Bills In a situation where the liquidity in the bond market remains low, the increase in the amount of issuance of JGBs and T-Bills in response to the government's emergency economic measures will have an impact on the market. Taking this into account, the Bank will conduct further active purchases of both JGBs and T-Bills for the time being, with a                                                    2 A positive interest will be applied from the May 2020 reserve maintenance period (from May 16 to June 15) onward. Twice as much as the amounts outstanding of the loans will continue to be included in the Macro Add-on Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) will be conducted until the end of September 2020.  3 view to maintaining stability in the bond market and stabilizing the entire yield curve at a low level. 4. The Bank decided to set the following guidelines for market operations as well as for purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs). (1) Yield curve control (an 8-1 majority vote) [Note 1] The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The long-term interest rate: The Bank will purchase a necessary amount of JGBs without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. While doing so, the yields may move upward and downward to some extent mainly depending on developments in economic activity and prices.3 (2) Purchases of ETFs and J-REITs (a unanimous vote) The Bank will actively purchase ETFs and J-REITs for the time being so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces with the upper limit of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively.4 5. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels. [Note 2]                                                    3 In case of a rapid increase in the yields, the Bank will purchase JGBs promptly and appropriately. 4 As for the guideline for purchases of ETFs and J-REITs, in principle, ""the Bank will purchase these assets so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 6 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen, respectively. With a view to lowering risk premia of asset prices in an appropriate manner, the Bank may increase or decrease the amount of purchases depending on market conditions.""  4 6. The Bank recognizes that its current powerful monetary easing measures, including the ones decided today, will contribute to supporting economic and financial activities, coupled with various measures by the Japanese government as well as those by the government and central bank of each country and region in response to the spread of COVID-19.

20200522,"1 May 22, 2020 Bank of Japan  Introduction of a New Fund-Provisioning Measure to Support Financing Mainly of Small and Medium-Sized Firms  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) held in April, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan instructed to swiftly consider a new fund-provisioning measure to further support financing mainly of small and medium-sized firms, with a view to addressing the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). At the unscheduled MPM held today, it decided upon the details by a unanimous vote (see Attachment). 2. The Bank already has implemented the following two measures to support financing mainly of firms: (1) purchases of CP and corporate bonds (maximum amount outstanding: about 20 trillion yen) and (2) the Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (fund-provisioning against private debt pledged as collateral: about 25 trillion yen <as of end-April>). Today, as a third measure, a new fund-provisioning measure was introduced (fund-provisioning against eligible loans such as interest-free and unsecured loans made by eligible counterparties based on the government's emergency economic measures: about 30 trillion yen). The Bank will refer to these three measures as the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (the Special Program: total size of about 75 trillion yen). The Policy Board decided, by a unanimous vote, to extend the duration of these measures by 6 months and continue to conduct them until the end of March 2021. 3. In addition, with a view to maintaining stability in financial markets, the Bank has been providing ample yen and foreign currency funds without setting upper limits mainly through purchases of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and the conduct of the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and has been actively purchasing exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs). 4. By conducting these measures, the Bank will continue to support financing mainly of firms and to maintain stability in financial markets. On this basis, it will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 for the time being and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary.2 Attachment  New Fund-Provisioning Measure  1. Overview The Bank will provide funds to eligible counterparties against pooled collateral for up to 1 year at the loan rate of 0 percent with the maximum amounts outstanding of eligible loans reported by those counterparties. 2. Eligible Loans (1) Loans based on the government's programs Interest-free and unsecured loans based on the government's emergency economic measures and loans guaranteed by the credit guarantee corporations in response to COVID-19 (2) Loans equivalent to 2. (1) Loans to small and medium-sized firms affected by COVID-19 which are equivalent to  2. (1) in terms of loan conditions (the maximum amount for each eligible counterparty: 100 billion yen) 3.

20200616,"1 June 16, 2020 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following. (1) Yield curve control The Bank decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period. [Note 1] The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The long-term interest rate: The Bank will purchase a necessary amount of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. While doing so, the yields may move upward and downward to some extent mainly depending on developments in economic activity and prices.1 (2) Guidelines for asset purchases With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guidelines. a) The Bank will actively purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) for the time being so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces with the upper limit of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively.2                                                    1 In case of a rapid increase in the yields, the Bank will purchase JGBs promptly and appropriately. 2 As for the guideline for purchases of ETFs and J-REITs, in principle, ""the Bank will purchase these assets so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 6 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen, respectively. With a view to lowering risk premia of asset prices in an appropriate manner, the Bank may increase or decrease the amount of purchases depending on market conditions."" 2 b) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2 trillion yen and about 3 trillion yen, respectively. In addition, until the end of March 2021, it will conduct additional purchases with the upper limit of the amounts outstanding of 7.5 trillion yen for each asset. 2. Japan's economy has been in an extremely severe situation due to the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) at home and abroad. Overseas economies have been depressed significantly, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this situation, exports and industrial production have declined substantially. Corporate profits and business sentiment have deteriorated, and the deceleration in the pace of increase in business fixed investment has become evident. With the continuing impact of COVID-19, the employment and income situation has shown some weakness, and private consumption has decreased significantly, mainly in services such as eating and drinking as well as accommodations. Housing investment has declined moderately. Meanwhile, public investment has increased moderately. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole but less so in terms of corporate financing, as seen in deterioration in firms' financial positions. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is at around 0 percent, mainly affected by the decline in crude oil prices. As for inflation expectations, relatively weak indicators have been observed. 3. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy is likely to remain in a severe situation for the time being due to the impact of COVID-19 at home and abroad, although economic activity is expected to resume gradually. Thereafter, as the impact of COVID-19 subsides, the economy is likely to improve, supported by accommodative financial conditions and the government's economic measures, as well as through the expected materialization of pent-up demand and a projected recovery in production from the decline brought about by COVID-19. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be negative for the time being, mainly affected by COVID-19 and the decline in crude oil prices. Thereafter, with the economy improving, the rate of change is expected to turn positive and then increase gradually. 4. With regard to risks to the outlook, there have been extremely high uncertainties over the consequences of COVID-19 and the magnitude of their impact on domestic and overseas economies. In addition, it is necessary to pay close attention to whether, while the impact of COVID-19 remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. 3 5. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will continue to support financing mainly of firms and maintain stability in financial markets through (1) the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), (2) an ample provision of yen and foreign currency funds without setting upper limits mainly by purchasing JGBs and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) active purchases of ETFs and J-REITs. For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

20200715,"1 July 15, 2020 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following. (1) Yield curve control The Bank decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period. [Note 1] The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The long-term interest rate: The Bank will purchase a necessary amount of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. While doing so, the yields may move upward and downward to some extent mainly depending on developments in economic activity and prices.1 (2) Guidelines for asset purchases With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guidelines. a) The Bank will actively purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) for the time being so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces with the upper limit of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively.2                                                    1 In case of a rapid increase in the yields, the Bank will purchase JGBs promptly and appropriately. 2 As for the guideline for purchases of ETFs and J-REITs, in principle, ""the Bank will purchase these assets so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 6 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen, respectively. With a view to lowering risk premia of asset prices in an appropriate manner, the Bank may increase or decrease the amount of purchases depending on market conditions."" 2 b) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2 trillion yen and about 3 trillion yen, respectively. In addition, until the end of March 2021, it will conduct additional purchases with the upper limit of the amounts outstanding of 7.5 trillion yen for each asset. 2. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will continue to support financing mainly of firms and maintain stability in financial markets through (1) the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), (2) an ample provision of yen and foreign currency funds without setting upper limits mainly by purchasing JGBs and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) active purchases of ETFs and J-REITs. For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

With a view to lowering risk premia of asset prices in an appropriate manner, the Bank may increase or decrease the amount of purchases depending on market conditions."" 2 b) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2 trillion yen and about 3 trillion yen, respectively. In addition, until the end of March 2021, it will conduct additional purchases with the upper limit of the amounts outstanding of 7.5 trillion yen for each asset. 2. Japan's economy has started to pick up with economic activity resuming gradually, although it has remained in a severe situation due to the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) at home and abroad. Overseas economies also have started to pick up from a state of significant depression. In this situation, exports and industrial production have turned to a pick-up. On the other hand, corporate profits and business sentiment have deteriorated, and business fixed investment has been on a declining trend. With the continuing impact of COVID-19, the employment and income situation has been weak. Private consumption has picked up gradually on the whole, although consumption of services, such as eating and drinking as well as accommodations, has remained at a low level. Housing investment has declined moderately. Meanwhile, public investment has continued to increase moderately. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole but those for corporate financing have remained less so, as seen in weakness in firms' financial positions. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) is at around 0 percent, mainly affected by the past decline in crude oil prices. Inflation expectations have weakened somewhat. 3. With regard to the outlook, Japan's economy, with economic activity resuming, is likely to follow an improving trend through the materialization of pent-up demand and supported by accommodative financial conditions and the government's economic measures. However, the pace of improvement is expected to be only moderate while the impact of COVID-19 remains worldwide. Thereafter, as the impact subsides globally, the economy is projected to keep improving further with overseas economies returning to a steady growth path. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be negative for the time being, mainly affected by COVID-19 and the past decline in crude oil prices. Thereafter, it is expected to turn positive and then increase gradually, as downward pressure on prices is projected to wane gradually along with economic improvement and the effects of the decline in crude oil prices are likely to dissipate. 4. With regard to risks to the outlook, there have been extremely high uncertainties over the consequences of COVID-19 and the magnitude of their impact on domestic and overseas economies. In addition, it is necessary to pay close attention to whether, while the impact of 3 COVID-19 remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. 5. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner.

20201218,"1 December 18, 2020 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. Japan's economy has picked up, but the pace of improvement is expected to be only moderate while vigilance against the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) continues (see Attachment). In this situation, financing, mainly of firms, is likely to remain under stress for the time being. Given these circumstances, the Bank of Japan judged it appropriate to extend the duration of the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) by 6 months and make adjustments to the program, with a view to continuing to support financing, mainly of firms. To this end, at the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) held today, the Policy Board of the Bank decided upon the following. Depending on the future impact of COVID-19, the Bank will consider further extension of the program if necessary. (1) Additional purchases of CP and corporate bonds (a unanimous vote) The Bank will extend the duration of additional purchases of CP and corporate bonds by 6 months until the end of September 2021. It will continue conducting purchases of these assets with an upper limit on the amount outstanding of about 20 trillion yen in total. Out of 20 trillion yen, 15 trillion yen will be for the additional purchases of CP and corporate bonds and it will be distributed between each asset depending on market conditions.1 (2) Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (a unanimous vote) The Bank will extend the duration of the Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) by 6 months until the end of September 2021. In addition, in order to further actively encourage private financial institutions to make loans on their own in response to COVID-19 mainly to small and medium-sized firms, the Bank will remove the upper limit of funds it provides to each eligible counterparty (i.e., 100 billion yen) against loans that private financial institutions make on their own, which are part of eligible loans under this operation.                                                    1 The maximum amount of additional purchases of CP and corporate bonds used to be 7.5 trillion yen for each asset. Aside from the additional purchases, the amounts outstanding of CP and corporate bonds will be maintained at about 2 trillion yen and about 3 trillion yen, respectively.  2 2. The Bank decided to set the following guidelines for market operations as well as for purchases of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs). (1) Yield curve control (an 8-1 majority vote) [Note 1] The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The long-term interest rate: The Bank will purchase a necessary amount of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. While doing so, the yields may move upward and downward to some extent mainly depending on developments in economic activity and prices.2 (2) Purchases of ETFs and J-REITs (a unanimous vote) The Bank will actively purchase ETFs and J-REITs for the time being so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces with the upper limit of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively.3 3. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will continue to support financing mainly of firms and maintain stability in financial markets through (1) the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), (2) an ample provision of yen and foreign currency funds without setting upper limits mainly by purchasing JGBs and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) active purchases of ETFs and J-REITs.                                                    2 In case of a rapid increase in the yields, the Bank will purchase JGBs promptly and appropriately. 3 As for the guideline for purchases of ETFs and J-REITs, in principle, ""the Bank will purchase these assets so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 6 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen, respectively. With a view to lowering risk premia of asset prices in an appropriate manner, the Bank may increase or decrease the amount of purchases depending on market conditions."" 3 For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels. [Note 2] 4. Given that economic activity and prices are projected to remain under downward pressure for a prolonged period due to the impact of COVID-19, the Bank will conduct an assessment for further effective and sustainable monetary easing, with a view to supporting the economy and thereby achieving the price stability target of 2 percent. In doing so, since the framework of ""QQE with Yield Curve Control"" has been working well to date, the Bank judges that there is no need to change it. The Bank will assess various measures conducted under this framework and make public its findings, likely at the March 2021 MPM.

Voting against the action: Mr. KATAOKA Goushi. Mr. Kataoka dissented, considering that it was desirable to further strengthen monetary easing by lowering short- and long-term interest rates, with a view to responding to an increase in downward pressure on prices and encouraging firms to make active business fixed investment for the post-COVID-19 era. [Note 2] Mr. Kataoka dissented, considering that, in order to avoid Japan's economy returning to deflation, further coordination of fiscal and monetary policy was necessary and it was appropriate for the Bank to revise the forward guidance for the policy rates to relate it to the price stability target.                                                    4 Attachment  Economic Activity and Prices in Japan: Current Situation and Outlook  1. Japan's economy has picked up, although it has remained in a severe situation due to the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) at home and abroad. Overseas economies also have picked up, although the impact of a resurgence of COVID-19 has been seen in part. In this situation, exports and industrial production have continued to increase. In addition, corporate profits and business sentiment deteriorated significantly but subsequently have improved gradually. Business fixed investment has been on a declining trend. With the continuing impact of COVID-19, the employment and income situation has been weak. Private consumption has picked up gradually on the whole, although consumption of services, such as eating and drinking as well as accommodations, has remained at a low level. Housing investment has declined moderately. Public investment has continued to increase moderately. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole but those for corporate financing have remained less so, as seen in weakness in firms' financial positions. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) has been negative, mainly affected by COVID-19, the past decline in crude oil prices, and the ""Go To Travel"" campaign. Inflation expectations have weakened somewhat. 2. Japan's economy, with the impact of COVID-19 waning gradually, is likely to follow an improving trend, supported by accommodative financial conditions and the government's economic measures. However, the pace of improvement is expected to be only moderate while vigilance against COVID-19 continues. Thereafter, as the impact subsides globally, the economy is projected to keep improving further with overseas economies returning to a steady growth path. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be negative for the time being, mainly affected by COVID-19, the past decline in crude oil prices, and the ""Go To Travel"" campaign. Thereafter, it is expected to turn positive and then increase gradually, since downward pressure on prices is projected to wane gradually along with economic improvement, and the effects of such factors as the decline in crude oil prices are likely to dissipate. 3. With regard to risks to the outlook, there have been extremely high uncertainties over the consequences of COVID-19 and the magnitude of their impact on domestic and overseas economies. In particular, the impact of the recent resurgence of COVID-19 at home and abroad 5 should be carefully monitored. In addition, it is necessary to pay close attention to whether, while the impact of COVID-19 remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. Reference Meeting hours: Thursday, December 17: 14:00-15:59 Friday, December 18: 9:00-12:06 Policy Board members present:    Mr. KURODA Haruhiko, Chairman (Governor)    Mr. AMAMIYA Masayoshi (Deputy Governor)    Mr. WAKATABE Masazumi (Deputy Governor) Mr. SAKURAI Makoto Ms. MASAI Takako Mr. SUZUKI Hitoshi Mr. KATAOKA Goushi Mr. ADACHI Seiji Mr. NAKAMURA Toyoaki  [Others present] December 17 From the Ministry of Finance: Mr. SHINKAWA Hirotsugu, Deputy Vice-Minister for Policy Planning and Coordination  (14:00-15:59) From the Cabinet Office: Mr. TAWA Hiroshi, Vice-Minister for Policy Coordination (14:00-15:59) December 18 From the Ministry of Finance: Mr. SHINKAWA Hirotsugu, Deputy Vice-Minister for Policy Planning and Coordination  (9:00-11:50, 12:00-12:06) From the Cabinet Office: Mr. AKAZAWA Ryosei, State Minister of Cabinet Office (9:00-11:50, 12:00-12:06) Release dates and times: Statement on Monetary Policy -- Friday, December 18, 2020 at 12:13 Summary of Opinions -- Monday, December 28, 2020 at 8:50 Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting -- Tuesday, January 26, 2021 at 8:50 "
20210121,"1 January 21, 2021 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following. (1) Yield curve control The Bank decided, by a 7-1 majority vote, to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period. [Note 1] The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The long-term interest rate: The Bank will purchase a necessary amount of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. While doing so, the yields may move upward and downward to some extent mainly depending on developments in economic activity and prices.1 (2) Guidelines for asset purchases With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guidelines. a) The Bank will actively purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) for the time being so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces with the upper limit of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively.2                                                    1 In case of a rapid increase in the yields, the Bank will purchase JGBs promptly and appropriately. 2 As for the guideline for purchases of ETFs and J-REITs, in principle, ""the Bank will purchase these assets so that their amounts outstanding will increase at annual paces of about 6 trillion yen and about 90 billion yen, respectively. With a view to lowering risk premia of asset prices in an appropriate manner, the Bank may increase or decrease the amount of purchases depending on market conditions."" 2 b) As for CP and corporate bonds, the Bank will maintain their amounts outstanding at about 2 trillion yen and about 3 trillion yen, respectively. In addition, until the end of September 2021, it will conduct additional purchases with an upper limit on the amount outstanding of these assets of about 15 trillion yen in total. 2. The Policy Board decided, by a unanimous vote, to extend by one year the deadlines for loan disbursements under the Fund-Provisioning Measure to Stimulate Bank Lending and the Fund-Provisioning Measure to Support Strengthening the Foundations for Economic Growth. 3. The Bank will continue with ""Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control,"" aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will continue to support financing mainly of firms and maintain stability in financial markets through (1) the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), (2) an ample provision of yen and foreign currency funds without setting upper limits mainly by purchasing JGBs and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) active purchases of ETFs and J-REITs. For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

Voting against the action: Mr. KATAOKA Goushi. Absent: Mr. AMAMIYA Masayoshi.          Mr. Kataoka dissented, considering that it was desirable to further strengthen monetary easing by lowering short- and long-term interest rates, with a view to responding to an increase in downward pressure on prices and encouraging firms to make active business fixed investment for the post-COVID-19 era. [Note 2] Mr. Kataoka dissented, considering that, in order to avoid Japan's economy returning to deflation, further coordination of fiscal and monetary policy was necessary and it was appropriate for the Bank to revise the forward guidance for the policy rates to relate it to the price stability target.                                                    Reference Meeting hours: Wednesday, January 20: 14:00-15:27 Thursday, January 21: 9:00-11:31 Policy Board members present:    Mr. KURODA Haruhiko, Chairman (Governor)    Mr. AMAMIYA Masayoshi (Deputy Governor) 1    Mr. WAKATABE Masazumi (Deputy Governor) Mr. SAKURAI Makoto Ms. MASAI Takako Mr. SUZUKI Hitoshi Mr. KATAOKA Goushi Mr. ADACHI Seiji Mr. NAKAMURA Toyoaki  1 Mr. AMAMIYA was present only on January 20.

20210319,"  1 March 19, 2021 Bank of Japan  Further Effective and Sustainable Monetary Easing  1. Assessment for Further Effective and Sustainable Monetary Easing At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Bank of Japan conducted an assessment for further effective and sustainable monetary easing (see Attachment 1). Based on the findings, the Bank judged that the following basic stance on monetary policy was important: with a view to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent, the Bank will continue with monetary easing in a sustainable manner and make nimble and effective responses without hesitation to counter changes in developments in economic activity and prices, as well as in financial conditions. In this regard, the Bank will take the following actions. (1) With a view to enabling the Bank to cut short- and long-term interest rates nimbly while considering the impact on the functioning of financial intermediation, the Bank will establish the Interest Scheme to Promote Lending. In this scheme, interest rates, which will be linked to the short-term policy interest rate, will be applied to a certain amount of financial institutions' current account balances (see Attachment 2). (2) In order to conduct yield curve control flexibly during normal times, the Bank will make clear that the range of 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield fluctuations would be between around plus and minus 0.25 percent from the target level. At the same time, it will introduce ""fixed-rate purchase operations for consecutive days"" as a powerful tool to set an upper limit on interest rates when necessary. (3) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) as necessary with upper limits of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively, on annual paces of increase in their amounts outstanding. While these upper limits were originally set as a temporary measure in response to the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the Bank will maintain them even after COVID-19 subsides.   2 2. Conduct of Monetary Policy for the Intermeeting Period Given the current situation of and the outlook for economic activity and prices, which are described in Attachment 3, the Policy Board of the Bank decided upon the following with regard to the conduct of monetary policy. (1) Yield curve control The Bank decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period. [Note 1] The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The long-term interest rate: The Bank will purchase a necessary amount of JGBs without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. (2) Guidelines for asset purchases With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guidelines. a) The Bank will purchase ETFs and J-REITs as necessary with upper limits of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively, on annual paces of increase in their amounts outstanding. b) The Bank will purchase CP and corporate bonds with an upper limit on the amount outstanding of about 20 trillion yen in total until the end of September 2021. 3. Future Conduct of Monetary Policy The Bank will continue with Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will continue to support financing mainly of firms and maintain stability in financial markets through (1) the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel   3 Coronavirus (COVID-19), (2) an ample provision of yen and foreign currency funds without setting upper limits mainly by purchasing JGBs and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) purchases of ETFs and J-REITs with upper limits of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively, on annual paces of increase in their amounts outstanding. For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

Findings of the Assessment A. Developments in Economic Activity and Prices under Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control QQE with Yield Curve Control, which the Bank introduced in September 2016 based on the findings of the Comprehensive Assessment, has the following three aims. The first, with a view to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent, is to maintain the output gap in positive territory for as long as possible, given that the mechanism of inflation expectations formation in Japan is largely adaptive. The second is to introduce a framework in which the Bank controls interest rates to appropriate levels while taking into consideration both the positive and side effects of monetary easing, with the expectation that monetary easing will be prolonged. The third is to strengthen the forward-looking element of inflation expectations formation with the inflation-overshooting commitment.  Following the Comprehensive Assessment, the situation where the inflation rate does not rise easily has continued, mainly because (1) the mechanism of adaptive inflation expectations formation in Japan is complex and sticky, (2) elastic labor supply has constrained wage increases, and (3) a rise in firms' labor productivity has absorbed upward pressure on costs. The impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has put downward pressure on prices recently. Under these circumstances, QQE with Yield Curve Control has kept real interest rates at low levels and improved financial conditions through a decline in funding costs as well as favorable conditions in financial and capital markets. As a result, the output gap has expanded in positive territory and positive inflation has taken hold with improvement in the employment and income situation. In addition, due to the improved output gap and tightened labor market conditions, labor force participation of women and seniors has increased and firms have improved their labor productivity. This shows that favorable economic developments have continued under the Bank's large-scale monetary easing. Against this background, positive moves toward addressing the medium- to long-term challenges facing Japan's economy have been observed.   5 With a view to achieving the price stability target of 2 percent, it is appropriate for the Bank to continue with QQE with Yield Curve Control, which has been effective in pushing up economic activity and prices.  B. Policy Effects of QQE with Yield Curve Control QQE with Yield Curve Control has been effective in pushing up economic activity and prices through a decline in interest rates. Specifically, the Bank found the following: (1) the policy effects have been transmitted mainly through a decline in funding costs and favorable conditions in financial and capital markets; (2) the effects of the decline in interest rates on economic activity and prices are relatively large for short- and medium-term interest rates; and (3) an excessive decline in super-long-term interest rates could lead to anxiety about the future sustainability of the functioning of financial activities in a broader sense and have a negative impact on economic activity by, for example, undermining people's sentiment.  C. Effects on the Functioning of the Japanese Government Bond (JGB) Market and Financial Intermediation Under yield curve control, the Bank controls short- and long-term interest rates to appropriate levels. That said, if fluctuations in interest rates stay within a certain range, they will have positive effects on market functioning without impairing the effects of monetary easing. It is important to strike an appropriate balance between maintaining market functioning and controlling interest rates by allowing interest rates to fluctuate to a certain degree, mainly in response to developments in economic activity and prices. From this perspective, as a measure to strengthen the framework for continuous powerful monetary easing, the Bank decided in July 2018 to conduct yield curve control flexibly, and such flexible conduct has been effective in terms of maintaining the functioning of the JGB market.  Due to prolonged low interest rates and structural factors such as the declining population, financial institutions' core profitability has remained on a downtrend and is likely to continue to do so. In the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices, the Bank, based on the Financial System Report, has been examining financial imbalances from a longer-term perspective. It was found that prolonged downward pressure on financial institutions' profits may (1) lead to a gradual pullback in financial intermediation and, on the other hand, (2) increase the vulnerability of the financial system, mainly as a result of financial institutions' search for yield behavior.   6 D. Effects of Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) and Japan Real Estate Investment Trust (J-REIT) Purchases ETF and J-REIT purchases have been containing instability in the market by lowering risk premia. In addition, the effects of purchases tend to be greater the higher the instability in financial markets and the larger the size of purchases. This suggests that large-scale purchases during times of heightened market instability are effective.  E. Inflation-Overshooting Commitment  Given that the mechanism of adaptive inflation expectations formation in Japan is complex and sticky, it is necessary to push up inflation under QQE with Yield Curve Control through improvement in the output gap. At the same time, the forward-looking element of inflation expectations formation is important, and in order to strengthen this, the Bank in September 2016 adopted the inflation-overshooting commitment. Through this commitment, the Bank commits to continuing to expand the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) exceeds the price stability target of 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. With this extremely strong commitment, in that the Bank promises to continue with monetary easing based on observed CPI inflation rather than the outlook for CPI inflation, it aims to strengthen people's confidence that the price stability target of 2 percent will be achieved. The ""makeup strategy,"" which is the strategy this commitment is implementing, was examined in this assessment using an economic model. The results of simulations reconfirmed that it was appropriate to employ this strategy as the Bank's monetary policy conduct. Thus, the Bank will continue to pursue the inflation-overshooting commitment.  II. Policy Actions A. Conduct of Yield Curve Control 1. Establishment of the Interest Scheme to Promote Lending Cutting short- and long-term interest rates is an important option as a nimble and effective additional easing measure. It is appropriate to cut those rates while considering the impact on the functioning of financial intermediation. With this in mind, the Bank will introduce a scheme which mitigates the impact on financial institutions' profits to a certain degree at the time of rate cuts depending on the amount of their lending. In this scheme, the Bank will apply certain interest rates as an incentive to financial institutions' current account balances, corresponding to the amount outstanding of funds that have been provided through its various fund-provisioning measures to promote financial  7 institutions' lending. The applied interest rates will be linked to the short-term policy interest rate (see Attachment 2).  The eligible fund-provisioning measures and the incentives will be categorized into three groups. As for now, funds provided through the Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) against loans that financial institutions make on their own will fall under Category I and an interest rate of 0.2 percent will be applied; funds provided through the Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) against loans other than those for Category I and against private debt pledged as collateral will fall under Category II and an interest rate of 0.1 percent will be applied; and funds provided through the Loan Support Program and the Funds-Supplying Operation to Support Financial Institutions in Disaster Areas will fall under Category III and an interest rate of 0 percent will be applied. Depending on the situation, the interest rates and the eligible fund-provisioning measures for each category will be changed as necessary at the Monetary Policy Meetings (MPMs).  This scheme will also contribute to enhancing the effectiveness of the additional easing measure of cutting short- and long-term interest rates. Market participants who are not expecting short- and long-term interest rate cuts as an option for additional easing tend to point to the impact on the functioning of financial intermediation. The scheme will enable the Bank to cut those rates more nimbly while considering such impact.  In addition, given developments in financial institutions' current account balances at the Bank since the introduction of the negative interest rate policy, the Bank will modify the method to calculate the Macro Add-on Balances under the Complementary Deposit Facility in order to narrow the gap between the actual Policy-Rate Balances and the ""hypothetical"" Policy-Rate Balances, which are calculated based on the assumption that arbitrage transactions fully take place.  2. Clarification of the range of fluctuations in long-term interest rates When the framework for continuous powerful monetary easing was strengthened in July 2018, the Bank, with a view to striking an appropriate balance between maintaining market functioning and controlling interest rates, announced to allow long-term interest rates (10-year JGB yields) to move upward and downward in about double the range, which was previously between around plus and minus 0.1 percent from the target level. Given that there have been times when the range of actual fluctuations in interest rates has become narrow, the Bank considers it appropriate to make clear  8 that the range of 10-year JGB yield fluctuations would be between around plus and minus 0.25 percent. That said, when, in particular, the yields temporarily fall below the lower limit in day-to-day movements, the Bank will not strictly respond to such developments.  3. Introduction of ""fixed-rate purchase operations for consecutive days"" One measure to stop a significant rise in interest rates is the fixed-rate purchase operations, through which the Bank purchases an unlimited amount of JGBs with certain maturities at fixed rates. With a view to further strengthening this operation, the Bank will introduce ""fixed-rate purchase operations for consecutive days,"" through which it will conduct the fixed-rate purchase operations consecutively for a certain period of time.  4. Conduct of yield curve control for the time being The Bank expects 10-year JGB yields to move within the range of around plus and minus 0.25 percent from the target level. An excessive decline in super-long-term JGB yields could have a negative impact on economic activity from a long-term perspective. That said, under the continuing impact of COVID-19 in particular, the Bank will conduct yield curve control with a priority on stabilizing the entire yield curve at a low level.  B. Asset Purchases and Others 1. Purchases of ETFs and J-REITs The Bank will purchase ETFs and J-REITs as necessary with upper limits of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively, on annual paces of increase in their amounts outstanding. While these upper limits were originally set as a temporary measure in response to the impact of COVID-19, the Bank will maintain them even after COVID-19 subsides. When a purchase is made, it shall be immediately reported to the members of the Policy Board.  With regard to ETF purchases, the Bank will only purchase ETFs tracking the Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), which is an index with the largest number of component stocks.1  2. Purchases of CP and corporate bonds The Bank will purchase CP and corporate bonds with an upper limit on the amount outstanding of about 20 trillion yen in total until the end of September 2021. A certain amount will continue to be                                                    1 As for ETFs composed of stocks issued by firms that actively invest in physical and human capital, the Bank will only continue to purchase those that are ""managed so that they track the indices the Bank deems eligible in accordance with the eligibility criteria for indices.""  9 purchased even after the purchases in response to the impact of COVID-19 end.  3. Participation of the Financial System and Bank Examination Department at the MPMs At the MPMs when the Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices is decided (four times a year), staff of the Financial System and Bank Examination Department will attend the meeting and explain developments in the financial system to the Policy Board.  10 Attachment 2  Outline of the Interest Scheme to Promote Lending  1. Purpose The Bank will establish a scheme to apply certain interest rates as an incentive to financial institutions' current account balances, corresponding to the amount outstanding of funds that have been provided through its various fund-provisioning measures to promote financial institutions' lending. The applied interest rates will be linked to the short-term policy interest rate. This scheme will enable the Bank to cut short- and long-term interest rates more nimbly while considering the impact on the functioning of financial intermediation. 2. Eligible Fund-Provisioning Measures and Incentives The eligible fund-provisioning measures and the incentives will be categorized into three groups as described below. The applied interest rate for Category II will be the absolute value of the short-term policy interest rate, and a higher rate will be applied for Category I and a lower rate for Category III. [Today's Decision]  Applied interest rate (incentive) Eligible fund-provisioning measure Category I 0.2% ?Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Financing in Response to COVID-19, when funds are provided against loans made by financial institutions on their own Category II 0.1% ?Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Financing in Response to COVID-19, when funds are provided against loans other than those for Category I and against private debt pledged as collateral Category III 0% ?Loan Support Program ?Funds-Supplying Operation to Support Financial Institutions in Disaster Areas Note: For all categories, twice as much as the amount of increase in loans will be included in the Macro Add-on Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank.  11 (Reference) Hypothetical example of the short-term policy interest rate being minus 0.2 percent  Applied interest rate (incentive) Eligible fund-provisioning measure Category I Higher than 0.2% To be decided in line with the purpose of this scheme Category II 0.2% Category III Lower than 0.2%     12 Attachment 3  Economic Activity and Prices in Japan: Current Situation and Outlook  1. Japan's economy has picked up as a trend, although it has remained in a severe situation due to the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) at home and abroad. Overseas economies also have picked up, although the impact of a resurgence of COVID-19 has remained in part. In this situation, exports and industrial production have continued to increase. In addition, corporate profits and business sentiment have improved on the whole. Business fixed investment has picked up, although weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has remained weak due to the impact of COVID-19. A pick-up in private consumption has paused recently due to increased downward pressure on consumption of services, such as eating and drinking as well as accommodations. Housing investment has declined moderately. Public investment has continued to increase moderately. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole but those for corporate financing have remained less so, as seen in weakness in firms' financial positions. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) has been negative, mainly affected by COVID-19 and the past decline in crude oil prices. Inflation expectations have weakened somewhat. 2. Japan's economy, with the impact of COVID-19 waning gradually, is likely to follow an improving trend, supported by a recovery in external demand, accommodative financial conditions, and the government's economic measures. However, the pace of improvement is expected to be only moderate while vigilance against COVID-19 continues. Specifically, downward pressure on face-to-face services consumption is likely to remain in the short run due to the impact of the resurgence of COVID-19 since last autumn. Thereafter, as the impact of COVID-19 subsides globally, the economy is projected to keep improving further with overseas economies returning to a steady growth path. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be negative for the time being, mainly affected by COVID-19 and the past decline in crude oil prices. Thereafter, it is expected to turn positive and then increase gradually, since downward pressure on prices is projected to wane gradually along with economic improvement and the effects of such factors as the decline in crude oil prices are likely to dissipate.  13 3. With regard to risks to the outlook, there have been extremely high uncertainties over the consequences of COVID-19 and the magnitude of their impact on domestic and overseas economies. In addition, it is necessary to pay close attention to whether, while the impact of COVID-19 remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained. Reference Meeting hours: Thursday, March 18: 14:00-15:46 Friday, March 19: 9:00-12:32 Policy Board members present:    Mr. KURODA Haruhiko, Chairman (Governor)    Mr. AMAMIYA Masayoshi (Deputy Governor)    Mr. WAKATABE Masazumi (Deputy Governor) Mr. SAKURAI Makoto Ms. MASAI Takako Mr. SUZUKI Hitoshi Mr. KATAOKA Goushi Mr. ADACHI Seiji Mr. NAKAMURA Toyoaki  [Others present] March 18 From the Ministry of Finance: Mr. SHINKAWA Hirotsugu, Deputy Vice-Minister for Policy Planning and Coordination  (14:00-15:46) From the Cabinet Office: Mr. TAWA Hiroshi, Vice-Minister for Policy Coordination (14:00-15:46) March 19 From the Ministry of Finance: Mr. NAKANISHI Kenji, State Minister of Finance (9:00-12:12, 12:22-12:32) From the Cabinet Office: Mr. AKAZAWA Ryosei, State Minister of Cabinet Office (9:00-12:12, 12:22-12:32) Release dates and times: Further Effective and Sustainable Monetary Easing -- Friday, March 19 at 12:39 Summary of Opinions -- Monday, March 29 at 8:50 Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting -- Thursday, May 6 at 8:50 "
20210427,"1 April 27, 2021 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following. (1) Yield curve control The Bank decided, by an 8-1 majority vote, to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period. [Note 1] The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The long-term interest rate: The Bank will purchase a necessary amount of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. (2) Guidelines for asset purchases With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided, by a unanimous vote, to set the following guidelines. a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) as necessary with upper limits of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively, on annual paces of increase in their amounts outstanding. b) The Bank will purchase CP and corporate bonds with an upper limit on the amount outstanding of about 20 trillion yen in total until the end of September 2021. 2. The Bank will continue with Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.

For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

20210618," 1 June 18, 2021 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting (MPM) held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following. (1) Extension of the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) The Bank decided by an 8-0 majority vote, with 1 abstention, to extend the duration of the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) by 6 months until the end of March 2022 with a view to continuing to support financing, mainly of firms, given that such financing is likely to remain under stress due to the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), although it has improved compared with a while ago. [Note 1] (2) Yield curve control The Bank decided by a 7-1 majority vote, with 1 abstention, to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period. [Note 2] The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The long-term interest rate: The Bank will purchase a necessary amount of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. (3) Guidelines for asset purchases With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided by an 8-0 majority vote, with 1 abstention, to set the following guidelines. [Note 1] a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) as necessary with upper limits of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively, on annual paces of increase in their amounts outstanding.  2 b) The Bank will purchase CP and corporate bonds with an upper limit on the amount outstanding of about 20 trillion yen in total until the end of March 2022. 2. Japan's economy has picked up as a trend, although it has remained in a severe situation due to the impact of COVID-19 at home and abroad. Overseas economies have recovered on the whole, albeit with variation across countries and regions. In this situation, exports and industrial production have continued to increase steadily. In addition, corporate profits and business sentiment have improved on the whole. Business fixed investment has picked up, although weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has remained weak due to the impact of COVID-19. Private consumption has been stagnant due to strong downward pressure on consumption of services, such as eating and drinking as well as accommodations. Housing investment has stopped declining. Public investment has continued to increase moderately. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has been seen. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) has been at around 0 percent recently due to a rise in energy prices, despite being affected by COVID-19 and a reduction in mobile phone charges. Meanwhile, inflation expectations have been more or less unchanged. 3. Although the level of Japan's economic activity, mainly in the face-to-face services sector, is expected to be lower than that prior to the pandemic for the time being, the economy is likely to recover, with the impact of COVID-19 waning gradually and supported by an increase in external demand, accommodative financial conditions, and the government's economic measures. Thereafter, as the impact subsides, it is projected to continue growing with a virtuous cycle from income to spending intensifying. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be at around 0 percent in the short run. Thereafter, it is expected to increase gradually, mainly on the back of continued improvement in economic activity, the rise in energy prices, and a dissipation of the effects of the reduction in mobile phone charges. 4. With regard to risks to the outlook, there have been high uncertainties over the consequences of COVID-19 and their impact on domestic and overseas economies. In addition, it is necessary to pay close attention to whether, while the impact of COVID-19 remains, firms' and households' medium- to long-term growth expectations will not decline substantially and the smooth functioning of financial intermediation will be ensured with financial system stability being maintained.  3 5. The Bank will continue with Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will continue to support financing mainly of firms and maintain stability in financial markets through (1) the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), (2) an ample provision of yen and foreign currency funds without setting upper limits mainly by purchasing JGBs and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying operations, and (3) purchases of ETFs and J-REITs with upper limits of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively, on annual paces of increase in their amounts outstanding. For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels. [Note 3] 6. Climate change issues could exert an extremely large impact on developments in economic activity and prices as well as financial conditions from a medium- to long-term perspective. The Bank considers that supporting the private sector's efforts on the issues from a central bank's standpoint will contribute to stabilizing the macroeconomy in the long run. In taking actions from the monetary policy side, the Bank deems it important to give consideration to market neutrality. Against this background, in order to support private financial institutions' various efforts in the field related to climate change, the Bank judged it appropriate to introduce a new fund-provisioning measure, through which it provides funds to financial institutions for investment or loans that they make to address climate change issues based on their own decisions. This new measure will be a successor to the Fund-Provisioning Measure to Support Strengthening the Foundations for Economic Growth. Although loan disbursement under the existing measure will continue to be made through June 2022 as scheduled, the Bank will launch the new measure likely within 2021. It will make public the preliminary outline of the measure at the next July MPM.   4 [Note 1] Voting for the action: Mr. KURODA Haruhiko, Mr. AMAMIYA Masayoshi, Mr. WAKATABE Masazumi, Mr. SUZUKI Hitoshi, Mr. KATAOKA Goushi, Mr. ADACHI Seiji, Mr. NAKAMURA Toyoaki, and Mr. NOGUCHI Asahi.

20211217," 1 December 17, 2021 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. Financial conditions in Japan have improved on the whole, despite the continued significant impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) on domestic and overseas economies. With regard to financial conditions surrounding large firms, issuance conditions for CP and corporate bonds have been favorable, and precautionary demand for liquidity has subsided in the loan market. Regarding small and medium-sized firms, their financial positions have been on an improving trend on the whole, but weakness has remained in some segments, such as the face-to-face services industry. Given these developments, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan, at the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, decided to extend the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in part by six months until the end of September 2022, with a view to continuing to support financing, mainly of small and medium-sized firms. The details of the decisions are as follows. (1) Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (a unanimous vote) a) Regarding the fund-provisioning against loans that financial institutions make on their own (""non-government-supported loans"") in response to COVID-19, mainly to small and medium-sized firms, the Bank will extend the implementation period by six months under the current terms and conditions. b) Regarding the fund-provisioning against loans that financial institutions make on the back of government support (""government-supported loans"") in response to COVID-19, mainly to small and medium-sized firms, the Bank will extend the implementation period by six months under the revised terms and conditions. Specifically, from April 2022 onward, this fund-provisioning will fall under Category III in the Interest Scheme to Promote Lending, for which the applied interest rate is 0 percent, and the amount to be added to the Macro Add-on Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank will be the amount outstanding of funds they receive. In accordance with the revised terms and conditions, the Bank will continue to provide funds to financial institutions against government-supported loans they make.  2 c) The Bank will complete the fund-provisioning against private debt pledged as collateral, which mainly consists of debt issued by large firms and housing loans, at the end of March 2022 as scheduled.  (2) Purchases of CP and corporate bonds The Bank will complete its additional purchases of CP and corporate bonds at the end of March 2022 as scheduled. From April 2022 onward, it will purchase about the same amount of CP and corporate bonds as prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, so that the amounts outstanding of these assets will decrease gradually to the pre-pandemic levels, namely, about 2 trillion yen for CP and about 3 trillion yen for corporate bonds. 2. The Bank decided to set the guidelines for market operations and purchases of assets other than Japanese government bonds (JGBs) as follows. (1) Yield curve control (an 8-1 majority vote) [Note 1] The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The long-term interest rate: The Bank will purchase a necessary amount of JGBs without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. (2) Guidelines for asset purchases (a unanimous vote) a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) as necessary with upper limits of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively, on annual paces of increase in their amounts outstanding. b) The Bank will purchase CP and corporate bonds with an upper limit on the amount outstanding of about 20 trillion yen in total until the end of March 2022. 3. Japan's economy has picked up as a trend, although it has remained in a severe situation due to the impact of COVID-19 at home and abroad. Overseas economies have recovered on the whole, albeit with variation across countries and regions. In this situation, exports and industrial production have continued to increase as a trend, despite remaining weak due to the effects of supply-side constraints. In addition, corporate profits and business sentiment have continued to improve on the whole. Business fixed investment has picked up, although  3 weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has remained weak due to the impact of COVID-19. Private consumption has picked up gradually, with downward pressure stemming from COVID-19, particularly on services consumption, waning somewhat. Housing investment has picked up. Public investment has been relatively weak, albeit at a high level. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has remained in some segments. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) has been at around 0 percent, mainly due to a rise in energy prices, despite being affected by a reduction in mobile phone charges. Meanwhile, inflation expectations have picked up. 4. Japan's economy is likely to recover as downward pressure stemming from COVID-19 on services consumption and the effects of supply-side constraints wane, while being supported by an increase in external demand, accommodative financial conditions, and the government's economic measures. Thereafter, as a virtuous cycle from income to spending intensifies in the overall economy, including the household sector, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace, albeit slower, above its potential growth rate. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to increase moderately in positive territory in the short run, reflecting the rise in energy prices. Thereafter, albeit with fluctuations due to temporary factors, it is projected to increase gradually as a trend, mainly on the back of improvement in the output gap and a rise in medium- to long-term inflation expectations. 5. Concerning risks to the outlook, the course of COVID-19 and its impact on domestic and overseas economies continue to warrant attention. In particular, there are high uncertainties over whether the resumption of economic activity can progress smoothly while public health is being protected. Attention also should be paid to a risk that the effects of supply-side constraints seen in some areas will be amplified or prolonged. 6. The Bank will continue with Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. The Bank will continue to support financing mainly of firms and maintain stability in financial markets through (1) the Special Program to Support Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19), (2) an ample provision of yen and foreign currency funds without setting upper limits mainly by purchasing JGBs and conducting the U.S. dollar funds-supplying  4 operations, and (3) purchases of ETFs and J-REITs with upper limits of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively, on annual paces of increase in their amounts outstanding. For the time being, the Bank will closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary, and also it expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

From April onward, it will purchase these assets at about the same pace as prior to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, so that their amounts outstanding will gradually return to pre-pandemic levels, namely, about 2 trillion yen for CP and about 3 trillion yen for corporate bonds. 2. Japan's economy has picked up as a trend, although some weakness has been seen in part, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19. Overseas economies have recovered on the whole,  2 albeit with variation across countries and regions. However, in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, global financial and capital markets have been volatile and prices of commodities such as crude oil have risen significantly, and future developments warrant attention. In this situation, Japan's exports and industrial production have continued to increase as a trend, despite the remaining effects of supply-side constraints. In addition, corporate profits and business sentiment have continued to improve on the whole. Business fixed investment has picked up, although weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has remained relatively weak on the whole, although improvement has been seen in some parts. A pick-up in private consumption has paused due to increased downward pressure stemming from a resurgence of COVID-19, particularly on services consumption. Housing investment has been more or less flat. Public investment has been relatively weak, albeit at a high level. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has remained in some segments. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food), despite being affected by a reduction in mobile phone charges, has been at around 0.5 percent, reflecting price rises of energy and other items. Meanwhile, inflation expectations have risen moderately. 3. Japan's economy, although expected to be affected by a rise in commodity prices, is likely to recover, with downward pressure stemming from COVID-19 on services consumption and the effects of supply-side constraints waning and with support from an increase in external demand, accommodative financial conditions, and the government's economic measures. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to increase clearly in positive territory for the time being due to a significant rise in energy prices, a pass-through of raw material cost increases, and dissipation of the effects of the reduction in mobile phone charges. Meanwhile, the underlying inflationary pressure is projected to increase, mainly on the back of improvement in the output gap and a rise in medium- to long-term inflation expectations. 4. Concerning risks to the outlook, the course of COVID-19, including variants, and its impact on domestic and overseas economies continue to warrant attention. In addition, there are extremely high uncertainties over how the situation surrounding Ukraine will affect Japan's economic activity and prices, mainly through developments in global financial and capital markets, commodity prices, and overseas economies. 5. The Bank will continue with Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner.

20220617," 1 June 17, 2022 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following. (1) Yield curve control (an 8-1 majority vote) [Note 1] a) The Bank decided to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period.  The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The long-term interest rate: The Bank will purchase a necessary amount of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. b) Conduct of fixed-rate purchase operations for consecutive days In order to implement the above guideline for market operations, the Bank will offer to purchase 10-year JGBs at 0.25 percent every business day through fixed-rate purchase operations, unless it is highly likely that no bids will be submitted.

Japan's economy has picked up as a trend, although some weakness has been seen in part, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19 and a rise in commodity prices. Overseas economies have recovered on the whole, albeit with some weakness seen in part. Exports and industrial production have continued to increase as a trend, but the effects of supply-side constraints have intensified lately. Business sentiment has seen a pause in its improvement recently, mainly due to the impact of supply-side constraints and the rise in commodity prices. Corporate profits have been at high levels on the whole. Business fixed investment has picked up, although weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has remained relatively weak on the whole, although improvement has been seen in some parts. Private consumption has picked up, particularly for services consumption, with the impact of COVID-19 waning. Housing investment has been more or less flat. Public investment has been relatively weak. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has remained in some segments. On the price front, with the effects of a reduction in mobile phone charges dissipating, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) has been at around 2 percent, mainly due to rises in energy and food prices. Meanwhile, inflation expectations, particularly short-term ones, have risen. 3. Japan's economy is likely to recover, with the impact of COVID-19 and supply-side constraints waning and with support from an increase in external demand, accommodative financial conditions, and the government's economic measures, although it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from the rise in commodity prices due to factors such as the situation surrounding Ukraine. Thereafter, as the negative impact of high commodity prices wanes and a virtuous cycle from income to spending intensifies gradually, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing, albeit more slowly, at a pace above its potential growth rate. The year-on-year rate of increase in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to be at around 2 percent for the time being due to the impact of rises in energy and food prices, but it is expected to decelerate thereafter because the positive contribution of the rise in energy prices to the CPI is likely to wane. Meanwhile, the year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food and energy) is expected to moderately increase in positive territory on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation expectations and wage inflation, and partly also of a pass-through of raw material cost increases.  3 4. Concerning risks to the outlook, there remain extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economy, including the course of COVID-19 at home and abroad and its impact, developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine, and developments in commodity prices and overseas economies. In this situation, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. 5. The Bank will continue with Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. For the time being, while closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19, the Bank will support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary; it also expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

20220721," 1 July 21, 2022 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. At the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan decided upon the following. (1) Yield curve control (an 8-1 majority vote) [Note 1] a) The Bank decided to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period.  The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The long-term interest rate: The Bank will purchase a necessary amount of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. b) Conduct of fixed-rate purchase operations for consecutive days In order to implement the above guideline for market operations, the Bank will offer to purchase 10-year JGBs at 0.25 percent every business day through fixed-rate purchase operations, unless it is highly likely that no bids will be submitted. (2) Guidelines for asset purchases (a unanimous vote) With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided to set the following guidelines. a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) as necessary with upper limits of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively, on annual paces of increase in their amounts outstanding. b) The Bank will purchase CP and corporate bonds at about the same pace as prior to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, so that their amounts outstanding will  2 gradually return to pre-pandemic levels, namely, about 2 trillion yen for CP and about 3 trillion yen for corporate bonds. 2. The Bank will continue with Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. For the time being, while closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19, the Bank will support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary; it also expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.

20220922,"1 September 22, 2022 Bank of Japan  Statement on Monetary Policy  1. Financial conditions in Japan have been accommodative on the whole. Although the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has remained in some segments of small and medium-sized firms in particular, financial positions, including of these firms, have been on an improving trend. Given these developments, the Policy Board of the Bank of Japan, at the Monetary Policy Meeting held today, decided to phase out the Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) and shift to fund-provisioning that would meet a wide range of financing needs (a unanimous vote). (1) Treatment of the Special Funds-Supplying Operations to Facilitate Financing in Response to the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)  a) Regarding the fund-provisioning against loans that financial institutions make on their own (""non-government-supported loans"") in response to COVID-19, mainly to small and medium-sized firms, the Bank will extend the implementation period by six months and complete the fund-provisioning at the end of March 2023. During the extended implementation period, it will provide three-month funds once a month. b) Regarding the fund-provisioning against loans that financial institutions make on the back of government support (""government-supported loans"") in response to COVID-19, mainly to small and medium-sized firms, the Bank will extend the implementation period by three months and complete the fund-provisioning at the end of December 2022. During the extended implementation period, it will provide three-month funds once a month. (2) Provision of an Unlimited Amount of Funds under the Funds-Supplying Operations against Pooled Collateral In order to support financing, mainly of small and medium-sized firms, even after the expiration of the above special operations, and with a view to meeting a wider range of financing needs, the Bank will set no upper limit on the amount of fund-provisioning under the Funds-Supplying Operations against Pooled Collateral, for which various types of 2 collateral are accepted. This change will be applied from the next fund-provisioning scheduled on September 27. 2. The Bank decided to set the guidelines for market operations and asset purchases as follows. (1) Yield curve control (a unanimous vote) a) The Bank decided to set the following guideline for market operations for the intermeeting period.  The short-term policy interest rate: The Bank will apply a negative interest rate of minus 0.1 percent to the Policy-Rate Balances in current accounts held by financial institutions at the Bank. The long-term interest rate: The Bank will purchase a necessary amount of Japanese government bonds (JGBs) without setting an upper limit so that 10-year JGB yields will remain at around zero percent. b) Conduct of fixed-rate purchase operations for consecutive days In order to implement the above guideline for market operations, the Bank will offer to purchase 10-year JGBs at 0.25 percent every business day through fixed-rate purchase operations, unless it is highly likely that no bids will be submitted. (2) Guidelines for asset purchases (a unanimous vote) With regard to asset purchases other than JGB purchases, the Bank decided to set the following guidelines. a) The Bank will purchase exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and Japan real estate investment trusts (J-REITs) as necessary with upper limits of about 12 trillion yen and about 180 billion yen, respectively, on annual paces of increase in their amounts outstanding. b) The Bank will purchase CP and corporate bonds at about the same pace as prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, so that their amounts outstanding will gradually return to pre-pandemic levels, namely, about 2 trillion yen for CP and about 3 trillion yen for corporate bonds. 3. Japan's economy has picked up as the resumption of economic activity has progressed while public health has been protected from COVID-19, despite being affected by factors such as a 3 rise in commodity prices. Overseas economies have recovered moderately on the whole, but slowdowns have been observed, mainly in advanced economies. Exports and industrial production have increased as a trend, with the effects of supply-side constraints waning. Corporate profits have been at high levels on the whole. In this situation, business fixed investment has picked up, although weakness has been seen in some industries. The employment and income situation has improved moderately on the whole, although some weakness has been seen in part. Private consumption has increased moderately, despite being affected by COVID-19. Housing investment has been relatively weak. Public investment has been more or less flat. Financial conditions have been accommodative on the whole, although weakness in firms' financial positions has remained in some segments. On the price front, the year-on-year rate of change in the consumer price index (CPI, all items less fresh food) has been in the range of 2.5-3.0 percent due to rises in prices of such items as energy, food, and durable goods. Meanwhile, inflation expectations have risen. 4. Japan's economy is likely to recover, with the impact of COVID-19 and supply-side constraints waning, although it is expected to be under downward pressure stemming from a rise in commodity prices due to factors such as the situation surrounding Ukraine. Thereafter, as a virtuous cycle from income to spending intensifies gradually, Japan's economy is projected to continue growing at a pace above its potential growth rate. The year-on-year rate of change in the CPI (all items less fresh food) is likely to increase toward the end of this year due to rises in prices of such items as energy, food, and durable goods. Thereafter, the rate of increase is expected to decelerate because the contribution of such price rises to the CPI is likely to wane. Meanwhile, the underlying inflationary pressure is projected to increase on the back of improvement in the output gap and rises in medium- to long-term inflation expectations and in wage growth. 5. Concerning risks to the outlook, there remain extremely high uncertainties for Japan's economy, including the course of COVID-19 at home and abroad and its impact, developments in the situation surrounding Ukraine, and developments in commodity prices and in overseas economic activity and prices. In this situation, it is necessary to pay due attention to developments in financial and foreign exchange markets and their impact on Japan's economic activity and prices. 6. The Bank will continue with Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing (QQE) with Yield Curve Control, aiming to achieve the price stability target of 2 percent, as long as it is necessary for maintaining that target in a stable manner. It will continue expanding the monetary base 4 until the year-on-year rate of increase in the observed CPI (all items less fresh food) exceeds 2 percent and stays above the target in a stable manner. For the time being, while closely monitoring the impact of COVID-19, the Bank will support financing, mainly of firms, and maintain stability in financial markets, and will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if necessary; it also expects short- and long-term policy interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels.  Reference Meeting hours: Wednesday, September 21: 14:00-15:59 Thursday, September 22: 9:00-11:44 Policy Board members present:    Mr. KURODA Haruhiko, Chairman (Governor)    Mr. AMAMIYA Masayoshi (Deputy Governor)    Mr. WAKATABE Masazumi (Deputy Governor) Mr. ADACHI Seiji Mr. NAKAMURA Toyoaki Mr. NOGUCHI Asahi Ms. NAKAGAWA Junko Mr. TAKATA Hajime Mr. TAMURA Naoki  [Others present] September 21 From the Ministry of Finance: Mr. OKU Tatsuo, Deputy Vice-Minister for Policy Planning and Coordination  (14:00-15:59) From the Cabinet Office: Mr. INOUE Hiroyuki, Vice-Minister for Policy Coordination (14:00-15:59) September 22 From the Ministry of Finance: Mr. AKINO Kozo, State Minister of Finance (9:00-11:30, 11:39-11:44) From the Cabinet Office: Mr. FUJIMARU Satoshi, State Minister of Cabinet Office (9:00-11:30, 11:39-11:44)  Release dates and times: Statement on Monetary Policy -- Thursday, September 22 at 11:51 Summary of Opinions -- Monday, October 3 at 8:50 Minutes of the Monetary Policy Meeting -- Wednesday, November 2 at 8:50 "
