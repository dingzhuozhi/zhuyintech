"And I think what we can see, and what many econometric and other studies show, is that the so-called neutral rate—namely, the level of the federal funds rate that is consistent with the economy growing roughly at trend and operating near full employment—that rate is quite depressed by historical standards.",1465987567.0,7.0,1465987627.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"Many estimates would put it, in real or inflation-adjusted terms, near zero.",1465987573.0,7.0,1465987633.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"Now, the path that you see in the dot plot for rates over time is importantly influenced—there is accommodation, and as we achieve our objectives, I think most participants feel that the accommodation in the current stance of policy needs to be gradually removed, but a very important influence in the out years is, what will happen to that neutral rate that will just keep the economy operating on an even keel? ",1465987608.0,7.0,1465987668.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"And I’ve often in my statements and remarks talked about headwinds that reflect lingering effects of the financial crisis; to the extent that there are headwinds, I think many of us expect that these headwinds would gradually diminish over time, and that’s a reason why you see the upward path for rates.",1465987637.0,7.0,1465987697.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
"But there are also more long-lasting or persistent factors that may be at work that are holding down the longer-run level of neutral rates—for example, slow productivity growth, which is not just a U.S. phenomenon but a global phenomenon.",1465987657.0,7.0,1465987717.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
"Now,you still see an assessment that that neutral rate will move up somewhat, but it has been coming down, and I think it continues to be marked lower.",1465987715.0,6.0,1465987775.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"Well, I’m not going to comment on participants versus voters.",1465987778.0,6.0,1465987838.0,5.0,-1.0,2.0
"You know, monetary policy—the Committee feels that monetary policy—when we are looking at several years, we should show the public what the views are of all the participants in the Committee, especially given that voting—voting rotates every year, and so that’s a decision we made.",1465987805.0,5.0,1465987865.0,5.0,0.0,0.0
But you asked me what it would take to have two increases.,1465987810.0,5.0,1465987870.0,5.0,0.0,0.0
"So, you know, the Committee as a whole never discusses, how many increases should we have this year or next year—that’s not a decision we’re making as a Committee.",1465987825.0,4.0,1465987885.0,5.0,1.0,3.0
We’re making decisions on a meeting-by-meeting basis and trying to give a sense to the public of what we’re looking for and what the basis of a decision will be.,1465987837.0,5.0,1465987897.0,5.0,0.0,0.0
"And, as I indicated, first of all, international uncertainties loom large here; we mentioned Brexit, the U.K. decision, obviously how that turns out is something that will factor into future decisions.",1465987854.0,5.0,1465987914.0,4.0,-1.0,2.0
And we’re also looking at the prospects for economic growth and continued progress in the labor market.,1465987863.0,5.0,1465987923.0,4.0,-1.0,2.0
"The forecast that you see in the SEP and the statement indicate the Committee continues to expect we will have moderate growth, 2 percent growth—so, you know, suggests healthy growth for the rest of the year and a pickup in growth in the second quarter, and we expect to see continuing progress in the
labor market.",1465987888.0,5.0,1465987948.0,5.0,0.0,0.0
"Now, we had questions about the growth outlook because we did see slower growth in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter.",1465987897.0,5.0,1465987957.0,5.0,0.0,0.0
"I have to say there, with respect to the slowdown we saw in consumer spending, that seemed to be out of line with fundamentals.",1465987906.0,4.0,1465987966.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
"We expected it to pick up, and we’ve seen very good evidence that it has picked up.",1465987911.0,4.0,1465987971.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
"Of course, with respect to inflation, we’re constantly evaluating whether or not incoming information is roughly in line with our expectations.",1465987962.0,5.0,1465988022.0,5.0,0.0,0.0
"Well, let me just say the labor market conditions index is a kind of experimental research product that’s a summary measure of many different indicators, and, essentially, that measure tries to assess the change in the labor market conditions.",1465988027.0,5.0,1465988087.0,4.0,-1.0,2.0
"As I look at it, and as that index looks at things, the state of the labor market is still healthy, but there’s been something of a loss of momentum: The 200,000 jobs a month we saw, for example, in the first quarter of the year, that’s slowed in recent months.",1465988051.0,4.0,1465988111.0,5.0,1.0,3.0
"Exactly what the reasons are for that slowing, it’s difficult to say.",1465988058.0,4.0,1465988118.0,5.0,1.0,3.0
"It may turn out—you know, again, we should never pay too much attention to, for example, one job market report.",1465988064.0,4.0,1465988124.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
"There’s a large error around that, we often see large revisions, we should not overblow the significance of one data point, especially when other indicators of the labor market are still flashing green: Initial claims for unemployment insurance remain low; perceptions of the labor market remain fine; data from the JOLTS on job openings continue to reach new highs.",1465988098.0,4.0,1465988158.0,3.0,-1.0,2.0
"We look at incoming data and are prepared to adjust our views to keep the economy on track, and, in light of that data dependence of our policy, I really don’t think that a single rate increase of 25 basis points in December has any—has had much significance for the outlook.",1465988163.0,3.0,1465988223.0,1.0,-2.0,1.0
So I think the levels of longer-term rates reflect essentially two things.,1465988222.0,1.0,1465988282.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"One is market expectations about the path of short-term rates over, if we’re considering, say, a 10-year Treasury security, what would be the path of short-term rates over the next
10 years.",1465988239.0,2.0,1465988299.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
"And the second factor is the so-called term premium, or the extra yield that investors demand in order to hold a longer-term security instead of to invest short term.",1465988255.0,2.0,1465988315.0,0.0,-2.0,1.0
"And clearly, market expectations for the path of short-term interest rates over the next 10 years remain low, and that is a factor.",1465988269.0,1.0,1465988329.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
"That is an important factor that’s, I think, holding down the level of longer- term yields.",1465988275.0,1.0,1465988335.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
"Now, when we engaged in longer-term asset purchases, our very purpose in doing that was to drive down longer-term yields by making these assets scarce— scarcer and, hence, more valuable to the public that wants to invest in long-term securities, and we were consciously attempting to drive down that term premium.",1465988316.0,0.0,1465988376.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"Now, we continue to hold a large quantity of those securities, but we’re not adding to them. But, in many parts of the world—the ECB, for example, and the Bank of Japan are also engaging in quantitative easing, buying longer-term assets and pushing down those term premia.",1465988337.0,0.0,1465988397.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
"And many of us believe, as a base case, it’s reasonable to assume that those rates will move up over time, but we’re not certain of that.",1465988410.0,1.0,1465988470.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
"The idea that a low neutral rate may be more— closer to the new normal, but you still do see some reversion.",1465988436.0,0.0,1465988496.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
"So I can’t give you a formula, I know you would probably like to have a number that’s a cutoff for what we need to see in a particular report.",1465988473.0,0.0,1465988533.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
"There are a lot of different indicators of the labor market—for example, the labor market conditions index that Binya referred to has 19 different indicators.",1465988488.0,1.0,1465988548.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"So, you know, I should say, over time, we should expect to see, as the economy comes closer to maximum employment, the likely pace of job gains is probably going to slow down somewhat.",1465988521.0,1.0,1465988581.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
And we have seen some slowing.,1465988524.0,1.0,1465988584.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
"But the recent couple of months was very low and, arguably, not even at the pace we need to see to maintain stable labor market conditions.",1465988534.0,1.0,1465988594.0,4.0,3.0,4.0
So we want to see an adequate pace of job creation.,1465988539.0,1.0,1465988599.0,3.0,2.0,4.0
"There might be revisions to previous months that would change our views, but there will be other surveys of employment intentions and other indicators of the labor market that we’ll focus— we’ll be focusing on. ",1465988554.0,2.0,1465988614.0,3.0,1.0,3.0
So we are very focused on assessing the economic outlook and making changes that are appropriate without taking politics into account.,1465988691.0,0.0,1465988751.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"Look, if the data— incoming data were, in the coming months, to justify the kind of gradual increases that we have long discussed, that we see as appropriate in light of the outlook, I think markets should not be surprised by such a decision if we make it.",1465988716.0,1.0,1465988776.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
"Well, we’re looking at both.",1465988752.0,0.0,1465988812.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"You know, I would say, with respect to the behavior of inflation, inflation is behaving roughly in the manner I would have expected; I have really not seen significant surprises there.",1465988767.0,0.0,1465988827.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"We’ve long said that an important reason that inflation is as low as it’s been is because of past declines in energy prices and increases in the value of the dollar, and as those factors began to dissipate, we would see inflation moving up.",1465988787.0,0.0,1465988847.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"Now, that’s exactly what we’re seeing, what we’re—that’s in line with our thinking and with the data.",1465988793.0,0.0,1465988853.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"So, those things have stabilized, their influence is dissipating.",1465988798.0,0.0,1465988858.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"And with respect to core inflation, which—now, that’s partly influenced also by the dollar, but trying to pull out the dollar and import price influence—core inflation seems to be behaving roughly as one would expect with well-anchored inflation expectations and in improving labor markets.",1465988822.0,0.0,1465988882.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"So I’m not seeing anything—inflation, even core inflation, is running under 2 percent.",1465988828.0,0.0,1465988888.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
I continue to think the evidence supports a projection that it will move up over the next couple of years back toward our 2 percent objective.,1465988839.0,0.0,1465988899.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
So we do monitor indicators of inflation expectations carefully.,1465988857.0,0.0,1465988917.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"Now, it’s very hard to know exactly what inflation expectations are relevant to actual price and wage decisions.",1465988865.0,0.0,1465988925.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"And so, for example, we have seen the Michigan survey, a measure of household inflation expectations, move down.",1465988876.0,0.0,1465988936.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
And there are actually good reasons to think that the inflation risk premium could have declined significantly and may be depressing those measures.,1465988922.0,0.0,1465988982.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
So the minutes are always—have to be an accurate discussion of what happened at the meeting.,1465988982.0,1.0,1465989042.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
So they’re not changed after the fact in order to correct possible misconceptions.,1465988990.0,1.0,1465989050.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
"There was a good deal of discussion at that meeting of the possibility of moving in June, and that appeared in the minutes.",1465989000.0,1.0,1465989060.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
"I suppose in the April statement, we gave no obvious hint or kind of calendar-based signal that June was a possibility.",1465989015.0,1.0,1465989075.0,3.0,2.0,4.0
So I do think that there were hints in the April statement that the Committee was changing its views of what it was seeing in a direction.,1465989072.0,2.0,1465989132.0,3.0,1.0,3.0
"We continue to say that we think, if economic developments evolve in line with our expectations, the gradual and cautious further increases we expect to be appropriate.",1465989087.0,3.0,1465989147.0,3.0,0.0,0.0
And I suppose I was somewhat surprised with the market interpretation of it.,1465989093.0,3.0,1465989153.0,2.0,-1.0,2.0
"So, I think, you know, I think we have seen some hints, perhaps preliminary indications, that wage growth is picking up.",1465989172.0,2.0,1465989232.0,5.0,3.0,4.0
"And as much as anything, I think it’s a sign of a generally healthy labor market, which is what our mandated objective is, to achieve maximum employment.",1465989185.0,3.0,1465989245.0,4.0,1.0,3.0
"So, in normal times, I think it’s very important that there be a separation between monetary and fiscal policy, and it’s a primary reason for independence of a central bank.",1465989242.0,4.0,1465989302.0,5.0,1.0,3.0
"We have seen all too many examples of countries that end up with high or even hyperinflation because those in charge of fiscal policy direct their central bank to help them finance it by printing money, and maintaining price stability and low and stable inflation is very much aided by having central bank independence.",1465989275.0,4.0,1465989335.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
"Now, that said, in unusual times where the concern is with very weak growth or possibly deflation—rather rare circumstances—first of all, fiscal policy can be a very important tool.",1465989293.0,4.0,1465989353.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
"Now, whether or not in such extreme circumstances, there might be a case for, let’s say, coordination—close coordination, with the central bank playing a role in financing fiscal policy; this is something that academics are debating, and it is something that one might legitimately consider.",1465989341.0,4.0,1465989401.0,3.0,-1.0,2.0
"So, of course, we do look at foreign rates, the prospects—and the prospects for growth in those economies in considering the stance of policy.",1465989565.0,2.0,1465989625.0,3.0,1.0,3.0
It creates channels through which domestic demand is depressed.,1465989597.0,3.0,1465989657.0,3.0,0.0,0.0
"At the moment, net exports—well, for quite some time and probably going forward, they will be somewhat of a drag on U.S. growth, so that’s a factor that we take into account.",1465989612.0,3.0,1465989672.0,3.0,0.0,0.0
And increases in the dollar that we’ve seen since mid-2014 have served to push inflation down as well; it can also have impacts on commodity prices that are relevant.,1465989626.0,3.0,1465989686.0,3.0,0.0,0.0
"When we have an outlook for continuing above-trend growth—that if we held rates absolutely flat, we have reason to believe inflation would overshoot our target—we would see a case to gradually raise rates over time.",1465989660.0,3.0,1465989720.0,3.0,0.0,0.0
"But, for example, if we were to see upside surprises to growth and to inflation and had to raise short-term rates faster, thought we should, one of the channels by which that would work would be the associated impact on the dollar.",1465989688.0,3.0,1465989748.0,1.0,-2.0,1.0
"Well, oil prices have had many different effects on the economy, and so we’ve been watching oil prices closely.",1465989727.0,2.0,1465989787.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
"As you said, falling oil prices pull down inflation.",1465989735.0,4.0,1465989795.0,2.0,-2.0,1.0
"You know, it takes falling oil prices to lower inflation on a sustained basis.",1465989743.0,2.0,1465989803.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
"Once they stabilize at whatever level, their impact on inflation dissipates over time.",1465989751.0,1.0,1465989811.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
So we’re beginning to see that happening.,1465989755.0,2.0,1465989815.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
