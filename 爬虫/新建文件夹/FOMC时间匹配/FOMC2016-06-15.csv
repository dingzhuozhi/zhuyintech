So let me first say that employment is a very important part of our mandate.,1505904208.0,0.0,1505904268.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
" We’re charged by Congress with trying to pursue maximum employment, and we have taken that very seriously.",1505904220.0,0.0,1505904280.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
" I’m very pleased and heartened by the improvement we have seen in the labor market, and at 4.4 percent, the unemployment rate has really fallen to quite a low level.",1505904242.0,0.0,1505904302.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
" As that’s happened, the unemployment rates for less advantaged groups in the labor market, particularly African Americans and Hispanics, has fallen more dramatically than that for the nation as a whole, reversing the outsized increases that those groups experienced when the financial crisis and Great Recession hit.",1505904259.0,0.0,1505904319.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
" So we certainly seek a strong labor market, but we have a dual mandate, which is inflation and unemployment, and we also have to be mindful of our obligation to achieve a 2 percent inflation objective over the medium term.",1505904300.0,1.0,1505904360.0,3.0,2.0,4.0
"Now, I recognize and it’s important that inflation has been running under our 2 percent objective for a number of years, and that is a concern, particularly if it were to translate into lower inflation expectations.",1505904313.0,1.0,1505904373.0,5.0,4.0,4.0
" For a number of years there were very understandable reasons for that shortfall, and they included quite a lot of slack in the labor market—which, my judgment would be, has largely disappeared—very large reductions in energy prices, and a large appreciation of the dollar that lowered import prices starting in mid-2014.",1505904351.0,2.0,1505904411.0,7.0,5.0,4.0
" This year, the shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, when none of those factors is operative, is more of a mystery, and I will not say that the Committee clearly understands what the causes are of that.",1505904359.0,3.0,1505904419.0,7.0,4.0,4.0
"Now, we do, in our regular projection, show fan charts indicating the typical size of forecast errors.",1505904360.0,3.0,1505904420.0,7.0,4.0,4.0
" All of the variables—GDP, the unemployment rate, and inflation—are forecast by ourselves and private forecasters with errors, and so there is variation in these economic variables from year to year.",1505904387.0,5.0,1505904447.0,7.0,2.0,4.0
" I would say our judgment, as I said in the statement, is that the shortfall is not largely related to cyclical considerations.",1505904387.0,5.0,1505904447.0,7.0,2.0,4.0
" You can see from the projections that the Committee participants submitted that we anticipate that core and headline inflation will move up close to our 2 percent objective next year—namely, that the shortfall this year is due to transitory factors that are likely to disappear over the course of the coming year.",1505904421.0,7.0,1505904481.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
But I want to emphasize that we do have a commitment to raising inflation to 2 percent.,1505904428.0,7.0,1505904488.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" And as we watch incoming data, the assessments that you see participants write down about the path of the federal funds rate, they are not set in stone.",1505904431.0,7.0,1505904491.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
 They are not definite plans.,1505904437.0,7.0,1505904497.0,5.0,-2.0,1.0
" But I want to point out that while there are risks that inflation could continue below 2 percent, which we need to take account of in monetary policy, monetary policy also operates with a lag.",1505904482.0,7.0,1505904542.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
 So at every meeting we try to assess the economic outlook and take account of information that’s been accumulated about the real economy and also developments in financial markets and put all of that together in assessing the course of the economy.,1505904577.0,5.0,1505904637.0,7.0,2.0,4.0
" So developments affecting asset prices and longer-term interest rates, the exchange rate—all of those aspects of financial conditions factor into our thinking.",1505904586.0,4.0,1505904646.0,6.0,2.0,4.0
But it’s not easy to get a clear read on the implications of asset prices for the overall outlook.,1505904591.0,4.0,1505904651.0,6.0,2.0,4.0
" Sometimes movements—upward movements in asset prices can, for example, reflect a change in market participants’—reduction in market participants’ estimates of the longer-run level of interest rates.",1505904617.0,6.0,1505904677.0,5.0,-1.0,2.0
" That’s important in determining the impact on the overall outlook, but, certainly, we are taking account of movements in asset prices in evaluating the appropriate stance of policy.",1505904675.0,5.0,1505904735.0,5.0,0.0,0.0
 So we have two policy tools that are available to us to use: the balance sheet and adjustments in short-term interest rates—our federal funds rate target.,1505904754.0,5.0,1505904814.0,7.0,2.0,4.0
" That is what we intend to use unless we think that the threat to the economy is sufficiently great that we might have to cut the federal funds rate— after all, we’ve moved it up to 1 to 1¼ percent and expect it to go up further—but a very significant negative shock to the economy could conceivably force us back to the so-called zero lower bound.",1505904868.0,7.0,1505904928.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
" We have said if there were that type of material deterioration in the outlook where we could face a situation where the federal funds rate isn’t a sufficient tool for us to adjust monetary policy, we might stop—we might stop roll-offs from our balance sheet and resume reinvestment.",1505904881.0,7.0,1505904941.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" But as long as we believe that we can use the federal funds rate as a tool, that is what we intend to do.",1505904886.0,6.0,1505904946.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
"So, if there are small changes in the outlook that require a recalibration of monetary policy, we will change our anticipated path and setting of the federal funds rate, but not, for example, change the caps on reinvestment or stop—continue reinvestment for a few months and then change it.",1505904917.0,6.0,1505904977.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
" We think that provides greater clarity to market participants about how policy will be conducted and will be, will be less confusing and more effective in terms of conducting policy.",1505904925.0,6.0,1505904985.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"So the only thing I would object to there, is you said that we are “locked in,” and I would say that we are not locked in.",1505904959.0,7.0,1505905019.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
" We believe that economic conditions will evolve in a way that will warrant gradual, further increases in our federal funds rate target, but if conditions evolve differently than that, whichever direction that might be—it might be that growth is more rapid, the labor market tightens more quickly than we assume, and inflation appears to be picking up more rapidly than we had expected—we have not promised, no matter what, that the path of interest rate increases will be gradual.",1505905009.0,7.0,1505905069.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" We believe that that will be appropriate, but we always watching the economy and will adjust policy as appropriate.",1505905017.0,6.0,1505905077.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
"Now, as I said, the hurdle to changing our plans with respect to the balance sheet, in some sense, is high.",1505905028.0,6.0,1505905088.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
" If conditions were to weaken, we would really only consider resuming reinvestment if it were what we refer to as a material deterioration, and I tried to explain why that is.",1505905037.0,6.0,1505905097.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
" But, you know, we will adjust monetary policy.",1505905044.0,6.0,1505905104.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
" What you see in the dot plot is each participant’s best guess, based on the information they have today, about what will be appropriate in light of their expectations about how the economy would evolve.",1505905060.0,6.0,1505905120.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
 And we think it’s helpful to show the public some sense that it helps in understanding our evaluation of the economy.,1505905063.0,7.0,1505905123.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
" But we’re assessing incoming data, and these plans are subject to change.",1505905064.0,7.0,1505905124.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
" What’s not subject to change is our commitment to doing everything in our power to achieve the goals that Congress has assigned to us, which are price stability or 2 percent inflation and maximum employment.",1505905085.0,7.0,1505905145.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
"So, certainly, if growth is stronger or if inflation picks up more rapidly, we have room.",1505905091.0,7.0,1505905151.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
" We have a certain amount of room now, and we have raised the funds rate four times.",1505905106.0,7.0,1505905166.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
So the term “trend inflation”—usually there are a variety of statistical techniques that can be used to extract a trend from a series.,1505905224.0,2.0,1505905284.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" Exactly what that means is, in some sense, a statistical thing, and there are methodologies that would show some modest decline in recent years in the trend.",1505905239.0,2.0,1505905299.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" After all, we’ve had a number of years in which inflation has been low.",1505905240.0,2.0,1505905300.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" As I said in answer to an earlier question, I think if you go back to, say, 2013 and consider the— until this year, the reasons why inflation was low are not hard to understand.",1505905268.0,3.0,1505905328.0,1.0,-2.0,1.0
" It’s a combination of slack in the labor market, declines in energy prices, and a strong dollar that pulled down import price inflation.",1505905275.0,3.0,1505905335.0,1.0,-2.0,1.0
So what’s important in determining inflation going forward is inflation expectations.,1505905279.0,2.0,1505905339.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
" By some—by many—by some survey measures of professional forecasters, those have been rock solid.",1505905288.0,2.0,1505905348.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
" We do also look at household expectations, which have come down some.",1505905292.0,2.0,1505905352.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
" Market-based measures of inflation compensation, as we mentioned in the statement—they have declined, and they’ve been stable in recent months, but they’ve declined to levels that are low by historical standards.",1505905315.0,1.0,1505905375.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" That might suggest that inflation expectations have come down, but one can’t get a clear read—there are risk premia built into inflation compensation that make it impossible to extract directly what inflation expectations are.",1505905330.0,1.0,1505905390.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"So, you know, there is a miss this year.",1505905338.0,1.0,1505905398.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
 I can’t say I can easily point to a sufficient set of factors that explain this year why inflation has been this low.,1505905343.0,1.0,1505905403.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" I’ve mentioned a few idiosyncratic things, but, frankly, the low inflation is more broad based than just idiosyncratic things.",1505905355.0,1.0,1505905415.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" We’ve had several months of data that have meaningfully pulled that down, and what we need to do is figure out whether or not the factors that have lowered inflation are likely to prove persistent or they’re likely to prove transitory, and that’s what we’re going to try to be determining on the basis of incoming data.",1505905401.0,1.0,1505905461.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
And you asked me about the policy implications.,1505905414.0,1.0,1505905474.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
So I’m not really going to try to explain what market participants are thinking.,1505905466.0,1.0,1505905526.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
 I think all of us—both market and FOMC participants’ paths have come down.,1505905476.0,1.0,1505905536.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
" Not in the last couple of quarters, but over the last several years, there’s been a growing recognition that the so-called neutral interest rate, consistent with the economy operating at maximum employment, that that rate seems to have come down, and most of the economic papers and research bearing on this topic suggest that it’s quite low.",1505905527.0,1.0,1505905587.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"Market—SEP—the FOMC participants—you can see by their estimates of the longer-run normal rate of interest, it is—this time it came down from—the median came down from 3 percent to 2.75 percent.",1505905537.0,0.0,1505905597.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
" So that shows that even in the long run, FOMC participants, in light of incoming data, are adjusting their views.",1505905546.0,1.0,1505905606.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" I would say they still believe that, in real terms, that neutral rate will be rising somewhat over the next few years.",1505905549.0,1.0,1505905609.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" With a 2 percent inflation rate, that long-run estimate in real terms amounts to 75 basis points, which is higher than the zero or slightly positive rates now.",1505905565.0,1.0,1505905625.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
 So that’s one factor that explains the path in the SEP.,1505905566.0,1.0,1505905626.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
 Market participants may have lower estimates or believe that a low neutral rate may be more persistent.,1505905579.0,1.0,1505905639.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"I mean, let me emphasize that, as I said before, there’s nothing set in stone about the policy paths that you see in the summary of projections.",1505905586.0,1.0,1505905646.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
 There’s a great deal of uncertainty around them.,1505905593.0,1.0,1505905653.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" And the mean rate, if they were asked to write that down, would take account of weighing all possible outcomes and likely would be lower than what participants are writing down as their most likely outcome.",1505905654.0,1.0,1505905714.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
 I will say that I have not had a further meeting with President Trump.,1505905718.0,0.0,1505905778.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
" I met with him early in my term, and I’ve not had a further meeting with him.",1505905719.0,0.0,1505905779.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"  So you asked me, what was the main—first, what was the main message of my speech, and I would say it’s that we put in place, since the financial crisis, a set of core reforms that have strengthened the financial system, and, in my personal view, it’s important they remain in place.",1505905834.0,1.0,1505905894.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" And those core reforms are more capital, higher-quality capital, more liquidity—especially in systemically important banking institutions—stress testing, and resolution plans.",1505905846.0,1.0,1505905906.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" And those four prongs of improvements in banking supervision have really strengthened the financial system and made it more resilient, and I believe they should stay in place.",1505905848.0,1.0,1505905908.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
But I also tried to emphasize—and I believe that they have contributed to growth and the availability of credit.,1505905869.0,1.0,1505905929.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
 I’ve also tried to emphasize that all regulators should be attentive to undue regulatory burden and look for ways to try to scale that back.,1505905875.0,1.0,1505905935.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
" And this is especially true after years in which we have implemented a large number of complex regulations, and we have been committed to doing that.",1505905881.0,1.0,1505905941.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
 I would point out particularly community banks that are laboring under significant regulatory burden.,1505905883.0,1.0,1505905943.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
" We have been looking for ways to scale back burdens, running the EGRPRA process, where we’ve listened to concerns among community banks and are looking for ways, for example, to simplify capital standards and reduce burdens, and that’s very important.",1505905917.0,2.0,1505905977.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
"More generally, we want to tailor—we want to, and we would like to see Congress as well—we can do things to appropriately tailor regulations to the risk posed by different kinds of banking organizations.",1505905932.0,2.0,1505905992.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" There are some things that Congress could also do to help that process, and we have made some concrete suggestions.",1505905933.0,2.0,1505905993.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" And then some of the regulations that we have put in place with other regulators since the crisis, like the Volcker rule, are really quite complex, and we’re working—we believe we should—and we’re working with other regulators to try to see if we can find ways, while carrying out what Dodd-Frank intended, that banking organizations not be involved in proprietary trading.",1505905960.0,3.0,1505906020.0,3.0,0.0,0.0
" Nevertheless, the implementation can be less complex.",1505905966.0,3.0,1505906026.0,3.0,0.0,0.0
 So that was my main message.,1505905981.0,2.0,1505906041.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
Your second question asked about what impact the Fed has had on income distribution because of the fact that stocks and homes tend to be disproportionately owned.,1505905989.0,2.0,1505906049.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
So first let me say that I will greatly miss Vice Chair Fischer.,1505906100.0,3.0,1505906160.0,2.0,-1.0,2.0
" He’s made enormous contributions to the FOMC and to the broader work of the Federal Reserve, and I have really enjoyed working with him and appreciated his wise counsel and friendship.",1505906118.0,2.0,1505906178.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
 It is conceivable that we will be down to three Governors.,1505906122.0,2.0,1505906182.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" I have full confidence that even if that happens, we will be able to carry out our complement of responsibilities.",1505906135.0,2.0,1505906195.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" There’s—every action that we are allowed to take under the Federal Reserve Act can be taken, even if we are a Board of three, although we will have to abide, as we always do, by the restrictions that are part of the Government in the Sunshine Act.",1505906160.0,2.0,1505906220.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
I would welcome a full complement of colleagues.,1505906163.0,2.0,1505906223.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" But, perhaps more important than that, I think it’s very important to have a broad range of views around the table as we deliberate on policy actions.",1505906180.0,2.0,1505906240.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
 I’ve had very good interactions with Randy Quarles and hope he will be confirmed.,1505906184.0,2.0,1505906244.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" I look forward to working with him, and, you know, I hope that the Administration will make other nominations to fill our slots.",1505906193.0,2.0,1505906253.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" We do face, in terms of longer-term deficits as the population ages, an unsustainable debt path that will require, I believe, some adjustments to fiscal policy, and I hope Congress will keep that in mind.",1505906280.0,2.0,1505906340.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" But beyond a few core principles, it’s really—I don’t want to weigh in on details.",1505906290.0,2.0,1505906350.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" We take our supervision responsibilities at the company very seriously, and we are attempting to understand what the root causes of those problems are and to address them.",1505906339.0,2.0,1505906399.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" Obviously, there are different—there are different estimates around—of what difference it made, but I would say that it’s effective.",1505906485.0,1.0,1505906545.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"It will be up to future policymakers to decide, in the event of a severe downturn, whether they think it’s appropriate to again resort to balance sheet—to adding assets to a balance sheet.",1505906506.0,1.0,1505906566.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
"I mean, you asked me what would it take for us to resume reinvestment, and I can’t really say much more than we said in the guidance that we provided, which is that if there is a material deterioration in the economic outlook and we thought we might be faced with a situation where we would need to substantially cut the federal funds rate and could be limited by the so-called zero lower bound, it is that type of determination that our Committee is saying would—might lead us to resume reinvestment.",1505906659.0,0.0,1505906719.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"So that’s—our Committee has been unanimous in affirming this statement of intentions, so, you know, I think that’s where our Committee stands.",1505906680.0,0.0,1505906740.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
" So that is a somewhat high bar to resume reinvestments, and that’s why, in answering previous questions, I would say, well, you know, if there’s some small, negative shock, our first tool—our most important and reliable tool—will be the federal funds rate.",1505906683.0,0.0,1505906743.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
" But if there is a significant shock that’s a material deterioration to the outlook, we would consider resuming reinvestment.",1505906692.0,0.0,1505906752.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
 So you asked first about the designation process.,1505906726.0,0.0,1505906786.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
" So during the time that I’ve been on the FSOC, only one firm was—several firms were designated before I participated.",1505906741.0,0.0,1505906801.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
" MetLife was designated during the time that I was there, and I have seen how the designation process works.",1505906747.0,0.0,1505906807.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
I do think designation is important.,1505906749.0,0.0,1505906809.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
 We saw during the financial crisis that some systemically important nonbanking organizations like Lehman and AIG—that their distress produced broad systemic consequences that were adverse for the U.S. economy.,1505906783.0,0.0,1505906843.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
