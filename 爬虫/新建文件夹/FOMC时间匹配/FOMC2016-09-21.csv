"So the Committee had, you know, our usual long discussion of global and domestic economic and financial conditions and then spent this morning talking about monetary policy.",1560940687.0,7.0,1560940747.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
"And I came to the view that I expressed to you, which is that we’re going to be monitoring—monitoring the crosscurrents and the other items that we’ve mentioned, but that we’d like to see more going forward.",1560940699.0,7.0,1560940759.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
"Particularly, we’d like to see whether these risks continue to weigh on the outlook.",1560940708.0,7.0,1560940768.0,4.0,-3.0,1.0
"So, generally, as I mentioned, many on the Committee do see a strengthened case—eight of those, a strengthened case for cutting rates.",1560940709.0,7.0,1560940769.0,4.0,-3.0,1.0
Eight actually wrote down rate cuts.,1560940713.0,7.0,1560940773.0,2.0,-5.0,1.0
A number of others see that the case has strengthened.,1560940715.0,7.0,1560940775.0,2.0,-5.0,1.0
"But the Committee wanted to see more, as I mentioned.",1560940718.0,7.0,1560940778.0,2.0,-5.0,1.0
And I also mentioned that some of these—some of these developments have been of quite recent vintage.,1560940728.0,7.0,1560940788.0,2.0,-5.0,1.0
"Again, many of these developments happened, you know, part of the way through the last intermeeting period.",1560940761.0,6.0,1560940821.0,3.0,-3.0,1.0
"Only seven weeks ago, we had a great jobs report and came out of the last FOMC meeting feeling that the economy, and our policy, was in a good place.",1560940774.0,2.0,1560940834.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
"Yeah, so I would say that we’re not looking at any one thing.",1560940831.0,3.0,1560940891.0,1.0,-2.0,1.0
So we’ll be monitoring the implications of all of those developments for the U.S. economic outlook.,1560940889.0,1.0,1560940949.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
"We expect to learn a good deal more, as I mentioned.",1560940890.0,1.0,1560940950.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
And we’ll be asking the question whether those risks are going to continue to weigh on the outlook.,1560940897.0,1.0,1560940957.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
But I think we believe that the right thing here is to watch carefully in the near term and see how these risks unfold and see whether they continue to weigh on the outlook.,1560940992.0,0.0,1560941052.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
"Obviously, we try to avoid going prematurely as well.",1560940993.0,0.0,1560941053.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"In this case, you know, there’s always some judgment in these things.",1560940998.0,0.0,1560941058.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"Let me let me say the same thing as I said the last time, before there had been any dissents, and that is that I think the process of careful, thoughtful dissent is a very healthy one, and I’ve always believed that.",1560941057.0,0.0,1560941117.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
And I feel like you make better decisions when you hear a disparity of views.,1560941063.0,0.0,1560941123.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
So that’s our principal focus.,1560941120.0,1.0,1560941180.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
So it could cut either way.,1560941120.0,1.0,1560941180.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"I see. Okay, right. Okay. So let me let me answer the inflation question first.",1560941217.0,1.0,1560941277.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
So we’re saying that we know—I noted in the statement and also in my—what I said here.,1560941225.0,1.0,1560941285.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
"We saw that market-based measures of inflation expectations, breakevens, dropped.",1560941227.0,1.0,1560941287.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
We noted that also in the statement.,1560941228.0,1.0,1560941288.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
And I noted it as a reason for us to—one of several reasons why it feels to us that the case for more accommodation has strengthened.,1560941239.0,1.0,1560941299.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
So we find that notable.,1560941245.0,1.0,1560941305.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
"Not only that, the actual forecast for inflation for this year, among FOMC participants, dropped a couple of tenths.",1560941253.0,0.0,1560941313.0,2.0,2.0,4.0
So that means a more prolonged shortfall of inflation.,1560941257.0,0.0,1560941317.0,2.0,2.0,4.0
"Let me say, on inflation, it’s something I’ve been concerned about for quite a long time.",1560941263.0,1.0,1560941323.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
It’s one of the principal reasons why I called for the review.,1560941264.0,1.0,1560941324.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"You know that my view on the dots is that they, overall, provide useful information for people, but that we need to do our absolute best to explain what they are and what they are not.",1560941317.0,2.0,1560941377.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
"Speaking of which, they are not a forecast of the group, they’re not discussed or debated at the meeting, they’re an input to policy more than an output of policy, and they’re also only the most likely case.",1560941328.0,1.0,1560941388.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"So, in a situation where there’s relatively high uncertainty, there’s the most likely case, but the second most likely case might only be a little bit less likely.",1560941329.0,1.0,1560941389.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
But that doesn’t show up in the dot. ,1560941333.0,1.0,1560941393.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
The dot is either one thing or it’s another. ,1560941335.0,1.0,1560941395.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"On the specific question of that, that’s just something we haven’t really engaged with yet, and it will depend very heavily on incoming data and the evolving risk picture as we move forward.",1560941396.0,1.0,1560941456.0,4.0,3.0,4.0
So it would be—so nothing I can say about that is specific to the near-term question that we face.,1560941397.0,1.0,1560941457.0,4.0,3.0,4.0
"More generally, though, the research you refer to essentially notes that, in a world where you are closer to the effective lower bound, it’s why—research kind of shows this—it’s wise to react, for example, to prevent a weakening from turning into a prolonged weakening.",1560941421.0,2.0,1560941481.0,6.0,4.0,4.0
"In other words, sort of, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.",1560941428.0,3.0,1560941488.0,5.0,2.0,4.0
So I think that is a valid way to think about policy in this era.,1560941439.0,4.0,1560941499.0,5.0,1.0,3.0
"I don’t know—and it’s always in the—I think it’s in the minds of policymakers, you know, during this era, because it’s well understood to be correct.",1560941443.0,4.0,1560941503.0,5.0,1.0,3.0
"The U.S. Treasury has responsibility for exchange rate policy, not the Fed, and we don’t comment, in that sense, on the level of the dollar.",1560941508.0,6.0,1560941568.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"We have the responsibility for maximum employment and stable prices, and we use our tools to achieve that.",1560941515.0,6.0,1560941575.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
And I gave a couple of reasons why that is the case.,1560941599.0,7.0,1560941659.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"First, it’s just the fact that some of these developments are so recent that we want to see whether they’ll sustain.",1560941609.0,6.0,1560941669.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
"So we felt that it would be better to get a clearer picture of things, and that we would, in fact, learn a lot about these developments in the near term.",1560941614.0,6.0,1560941674.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
"Ultimately, the question we’re going to be asking ourselves is, are these risks going to be continuing to weigh on the outlook?",1560941623.0,6.0,1560941683.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
"Well, you gave a pretty good picture.",1560941657.0,7.0,1560941717.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"I mean, it’s a complicated picture, and, you know, the answer is, we look at all of it.",1560941666.0,7.0,1560941726.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"But I would say, the big pieces of it are this: The baseline outlook has been a good one, and that has basically been consumer spending coming back up in the second quarter.",1560941685.0,7.0,1560941745.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
"That is coming true. And consumer spending is at a healthy level, and that makes sense.",1560941687.0,7.0,1560941747.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
You’ve got a tight labor market.,1560941688.0,7.0,1560941748.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
You’ve got companies in surveys saying that labor is scarce.,1560941691.0,7.0,1560941751.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
You’ve got workers in surveys saying that jobs are plentiful.,1560941693.0,7.0,1560941753.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
You’ve got wages going up.,1560941694.0,7.0,1560941754.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
You’ve got high levels of household confidence.,1560941696.0,7.0,1560941756.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
"So, all of that, underlying fundamentals for the consumer spending part of the economy, which is 70 percent of the economy, is quite solid.",1560941708.0,7.0,1560941768.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
"Job creation, if you take a three-month average, is still well above, you know, the entry—level of entry into the workforce.",1560941714.0,7.0,1560941774.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
So that part of the economy is solid.,1560941718.0,7.0,1560941778.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
"You mentioned manufacturing, and we’re seeing this all around the world.",1560941719.0,7.0,1560941779.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
"Manufacturing, investment, and trade have been weaker.",1560941723.0,7.0,1560941783.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"But you do see growth in services, so you—this pattern around the world of weak manufacturing but growth in the far larger part of the services economy, which has led to low unemployment, good job creation, rising wages, that’s kind of the two big pieces of it that you see.",1560941784.0,7.0,1560941844.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
Then you see the crosscurrents.,1560941794.0,7.0,1560941854.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
If you lay the crosscurrents on top of that—concerns about global growth and trade developments—you have the full picture.,1560941799.0,7.0,1560941859.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
And they do support economic activity through a number of channels that are reasonably well understood—some more directly tied to interest rates than others.,1560941859.0,7.0,1560941919.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
But we do generally believe that—that our interest rate policy can support demand and support business investment as well.,1560941867.0,7.0,1560941927.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"And I just would say, that’s why we think—it’s one of the reasons why we think it’s so important to sustain the expansion, keep it going, because we really are benefiting groups that haven’t seen, you know, this kind of prosperity in a long time.",1560941917.0,7.0,1560941977.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
"So we take the—you know, we take the crosscurrents as a given, and we have our tools.",1560941920.0,7.0,1560941980.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
"You know, I don’t—I don’t discuss elected officials publicly or privately, really.",1560941979.0,6.0,1560942039.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
"So, on your specific question of digital currencies replacing central bank currencies, I think we’re a long way from that.",1560942036.0,7.0,1560942096.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
"And, of course, the—so I think we’re a long way from that.",1560942038.0,7.0,1560942098.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
Digital currencies are in their infancy.,1560942039.0,7.0,1560942099.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
"You know, Facebook, I believe, has made quite broad rounds in—around the world really with regulators, supervisors, and lots of people to discuss their plans, and that certainly includes us.",1560942068.0,6.0,1560942128.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
They play into our world through consumer protection and money laundering and things like that.,1560942123.0,6.0,1560942183.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
We have—we’ve said that we wouldn’t look at raising the target rate for inflation.,1560942201.0,4.0,1560942261.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
"We did say that. And the reason is, it’s become a global norm, 2 percent.",1560942204.0,4.0,1560942264.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
Our statutory mandate is price stability.,1560942208.0,4.0,1560942268.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
"And so we’re actually taking a less—we’re looking at less radical ideas, such as how to make the 2 percent inflation objective more credible.",1560942221.0,4.0,1560942281.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
"This gives me a chance to say a couple things about the review and Chicago, in particular.",1560942221.0,4.0,1560942281.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
So it’s a new thing for us.,1560942223.0,4.0,1560942283.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
It’s something that—I thought it was both appropriate and important for us to do.,1560942225.0,4.0,1560942285.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
"It’ll be a yearlong, or even longer, process, looking at our strategy, tools, and communications.",1560942236.0,4.0,1560942296.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
"And it’s meant to be a way to open ourselves up, to let the sunshine in, and have dialogue and criticism with the constituencies that we serve.",1560942245.0,4.0,1560942305.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
"And they were—there, I think, people were quite struck by their intervention, which was really uniformly around how important maximum employment is and what it means in their communities.",1560942279.0,4.0,1560942339.0,2.0,-2.0,1.0
" You know, the idea being, they haven’t had, you know, a bull market in these communities.",1560942281.0,4.0,1560942341.0,2.0,-2.0,1.0
"They haven’t had, just, a booming economy.",1560942282.0,4.0,1560942342.0,2.0,-2.0,1.0
"What they have had is low unemployment, lots of social problems.",1560942286.0,4.0,1560942346.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
"And that is, I think, you know, for someone who does this work, that was very focusing and motivating, too.",1560942310.0,4.0,1560942370.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
"So I think everybody thought, you know, that’s—that was really quite worth doing.",1560942314.0,4.0,1560942374.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
"So the 2013 guidance is not binding, and that’s what came out of the GAO review.",1560942472.0,5.0,1560942532.0,5.0,0.0,0.0
But that’s really the beginning of this—of the story.,1560942473.0,5.0,1560942533.0,5.0,0.0,0.0
"You know, we have the authority we need to examine the banks for safety and soundness exposure.",1560942479.0,5.0,1560942539.0,6.0,1.0,3.0
"So, this—the first thing you start with as a bank supervisor is the risks that the banks are taking to themselves through their portfolio, through the risks that they’re running and the pipeline—you know, the obligations that they’ve undertaken to underwrite deals.",1560942506.0,6.0,1560942566.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
And so we monitor that very carefully—so do the banks—and you see exposures that are much smaller than they were before the crisis.,1560942507.0,6.0,1560942567.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"And, by the way, we test that regularly in the stress tests.",1560942508.0,6.0,1560942568.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"I think, internationally, not as much, and the Financial Stability Board is actually looking more carefully at that.",1560942562.0,6.0,1560942622.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"And we—you know, we monitor those vehicles to see what they are.",1560942567.0,6.0,1560942627.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"And they’re actually pretty stably funded, in the sense that there’s no run risk, but there’s still macroeconomic risk.",1560942571.0,6.0,1560942631.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"So I don’t, I don’t—you know, I no longer am day-to-day involved in this as I was before I took this job.",1560942643.0,6.0,1560942703.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"But my sense is, though, that that’s really not the problem.",1560942645.0,6.0,1560942705.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"I’m not saying it’s perfect, but I think we do understand what risks the banks are running.",1560942650.0,6.0,1560942710.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"And really the question is, how concerned should we be about large holdings by market-based vehicles that I mentioned, and what risks do they present?",1560942658.0,6.0,1560942718.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"You know, we have to be closer, because more jobs are being created than people are entering the labor force.",1560942705.0,6.0,1560942765.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"You know, by just lots and lots of numbers, the labor market is in a good place.",1560942717.0,6.0,1560942777.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"So what’s, I guess, a little surprising, though, is that you could reach these levels of unemployment late—you know, long into a cycle, let’s say, and not see even higher wages that are pushing up on inflation, because wages at this level, even though they’re growing at a healthy rate, at an appropriate rate, they’re not growing at a rate that would provide much upward thrust for inflation.",1560942766.0,6.0,1560942826.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"So, you know, we watch—we watch all of this very carefully, and I think we’re very careful about not assuming that we’re, you know, that would—that there’s no more slack in the labor market.",1560942773.0,6.0,1560942833.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
