I’ll try to respond to those questions.,1474454524.0,1.0,1474454584.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
 Let me try to set out again how the Committee sees the economy and what we’re looking for.,1474454532.0,1.0,1474454592.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
 We’re generally pleased with how the U.S. economy is doing.,1474454536.0,0.0,1474454596.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
 Growth was weak in the first half of the year; we’re seeing definite evidence that the economy is now expanding more strongly.,1474454545.0,0.0,1474454605.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
" As I mentioned, payroll gains in recent months have been solid, averaging around 180,000 per month, which is less than the pace in 2015, but, as I mentioned, it’s well above what’s needed to provide jobs for new entrants into the labor force over time.",1474454564.0,0.0,1474454624.0,2.0,2.0,4.0
 The unemployment rate is pretty close to most FOMC participants’ estimates of its longer-run equilibrium value.,1474454573.0,0.0,1474454633.0,2.0,2.0,4.0
" But, as I mentioned, that rate and other measures of labor utilization are little changed since the beginning of the year.",1474454582.0,0.0,1474454642.0,3.0,3.0,4.0
" I don’t see that as bad news, because it may reflect that the strong labor market is attracting people from outside the labor force back into employment.",1474454594.0,0.0,1474454654.0,2.0,2.0,4.0
 The labor force participation rates increased on balance since late last year.,1474454599.0,0.0,1474454659.0,2.0,2.0,4.0
" It has—it is on a declining demographic trend, and the fact that it’s increased shows a substantial number of people are being attracted into the labor market.",1474454613.0,1.0,1474454673.0,3.0,2.0,4.0
The employment-to-population ratio has also continued to increase.,1474454618.0,1.0,1474454678.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
" Now, we were not really certain that this is something that would happen as the labor market strengthened, and it’s good to see that development has taken place.",1474454629.0,2.0,1474454689.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" And that is some news that we’ve received in recent months, that the labor market does have that potential to have people come back in without the unemployment rate coming down.",1474454642.0,3.0,1474454702.0,2.0,-1.0,2.0
" So we’re not seeing strong pressures on utilization suggesting overheating, and my assessment would be, based on this evidence, that the economy has a little more room to run than might have been previously thought.",1474454659.0,2.0,1474454719.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
 That’s good news.,1474454660.0,2.0,1474454720.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
"Remember that inflation continues below 2 percent, although we expect it to move up over time.",1474454669.0,2.0,1474454729.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
 So the Committee agrees that risks to the outlook have become roughly balanced.,1474454676.0,3.0,1474454736.0,1.0,-2.0,1.0
 We expect labor market conditions to continue strengthening.,1474454680.0,2.0,1474454740.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
 And we are generally agreed that gradual increases in the federal funds rate to remove what is a modest degree of accommodation will be appropriate.,1474454694.0,1.0,1474454754.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
 But we don’t see the economy as overheating now.,1474454699.0,2.0,1474454759.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
" So, for the time being, we’re going to watch incoming evidence, and you can see from the SEP that most participants do expect that one increase in the federal funds rate will be appropriate this year.",1474454748.0,1.0,1474454808.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
" So it is true that our estimates of the neutral rate are coming down, and that’s what’s largely responsible for that shift.",1474454801.0,2.0,1474454861.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
" At the same time, we generally agree that the stance of monetary policy is somewhat accommodative.",1474454812.0,2.0,1474454872.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
" So 180,000 jobs a month is a faster pace of employment growth than is sustainable in the longer run.",1474454821.0,1.0,1474454881.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" Now, we have seen people come into the labor force and maybe more than would be expected, which is why the unemployment rate hasn’t fallen.",1474454830.0,1.0,1474454890.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
 But that’s probably not something that is possible without the economy overheating on an indefinite basis.,1474454839.0,1.0,1474454899.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
 So policy needs to be forward looking.,1474454843.0,1.0,1474454903.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
"Nevertheless, we don’t want the economy to overheat, and if things continue on the current course, I think that some gradual increases will be appropriate.",1474454897.0,0.0,1474454957.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
"Well, I did say at Jackson Hole that I thought the case for a rate increase had strengthened, and that assessment is included in today’s statement.",1474454958.0,1.0,1474455018.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
 So I think most of my colleagues agree—agree with that assessment.,1474454963.0,1.0,1474455023.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
 I think we are trying to understand some difficult issues.,1474454968.0,1.0,1474455028.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" There is less disagreement among participants in the Committee than you might think, listening to speeches and commentary.",1474454981.0,1.0,1474455041.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" I think we all agree that the economy is making progress, that we are close to an unemployment rate that is one that’s sustainable in the longer run.",1474454993.0,1.0,1474455053.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" We all agree we are undershooting our inflation goal, and that we want to make sure we stay on a course that raises that to 2 percent.",1474455003.0,1.0,1474455063.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
" And we’re struggling with a difficult set of issues about what is the “new normal” in this economy and in the global economy more generally, which explains why we keep revising down the rate path.",1474455019.0,1.0,1474455079.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
" And, you know, it’s very important that in a body like ours that a whole range of views are expressed, that we have independent- minded people who gather together and discuss these issues.",1474455038.0,1.0,1474455098.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
 And I think it’s a very good thing that the FOMC is not a body that suffers from groupthink.,1474455081.0,0.0,1474455141.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
" And you see that—you see that’s one of the, you know, real worries in an organization, that everybody thinks identically.",1474455090.0,1.0,1474455150.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" But there’s a lot that we share in common and express, both in our statement and in our speeches.",1474455096.0,1.0,1474455156.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"Well, I think Congress very wisely established the Federal Reserve as an independent agency in order to insulate monetary policy from short-term political pressures.",1474455153.0,1.0,1474455213.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
And I can say emphatically that partisan politics plays no role in our decisions about the appropriate stance of monetary policy.,1474455164.0,1.0,1474455224.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
We are trying to decide what the best policy is to foster price stability and maximum employment and to manage the variety of risks that we see as affecting the outlook.,1474455180.0,1.0,1474455240.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" We do not discuss politics at our meetings, and we do not take politics into account in our decisions.",1474455188.0,1.0,1474455248.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" And the decision not to raise rates today and to wait for some further evidence that we’re continuing on this course is largely based on the judgment that we’re not seeing evidence that the economy is overheating, and that we are seeing evidence that people are being drawn in—in larger numbers than at least I would have expected—into the labor market, and that that’s healthy to continue, but that, nevertheless, we do need to be forward looking.",1474455228.0,1.0,1474455288.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
" And if we continue along this course, it likely will be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate.",1474455235.0,1.0,1474455295.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
 And November you asked about as well.,1474455238.0,1.0,1474455298.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
"So you asked, first: What evidence would suggest that the neutral real rate is moving up?",1474455292.0,0.0,1474455352.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
" But if unemployment were moving down faster than we had anticipated, if we saw faster growth or upward pressure on inflation, that would be suggestive of the appropriateness of reevaluating whether or not the neutral funds rate had increased.",1474455329.0,1.0,1474455389.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" I mean, the downward revisions reflect the fact that, while the economy has made a lot of progress, it’s only made that progress in the context of a monetary policy that has been characterized by extremely low interest rates and negative real yields for a very long period of time.",1474455350.0,1.0,1474455410.0,4.0,3.0,4.0
"So, in most advanced nations now, we have highly accommodative policies, and they seem to be necessary for countries to be able to achieve their inflation and employment objectives.",1474455386.0,1.0,1474455446.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
 And that’s characteristic of a—an environment in which the neutral rate—interest rates both here and in advanced countries around the globe appear to be very low.,1474455401.0,1.0,1474455461.0,3.0,2.0,4.0
" And that is an environment that, if we do have to live with that for a long time, we have to be aware that it does give rise to a reach for yield as individuals and investors seek to, perhaps, take on risk or lengthen maturities to seek higher—to seek higher yields.",1474455428.0,3.0,1474455488.0,1.0,-2.0,1.0
And I think we should be concerned about that to the extent it creates financial stability risks.,1474455436.0,3.0,1474455496.0,1.0,-2.0,1.0
 And we are very aware that those are possible.,1474455439.0,3.0,1474455499.0,1.0,-2.0,1.0
 We engage in regular assessments of financial stability factors that bear on financial stability.,1474455450.0,3.0,1474455510.0,1.0,-2.0,1.0
" Overall, I would say that the threats to financial stability I would characterize, at this point, as moderate.",1474455459.0,3.0,1474455519.0,1.0,-2.0,1.0
" Not—I mean—so, I would characterize it as moderate.",1474455465.0,3.0,1474455525.0,1.0,-2.0,1.0
" I would say, in the area of commercial real estate, while valuations are high, we are seeing some tightening of lending standards and less debt growth associated with that rise in commercial real estate prices.",1474455517.0,1.0,1474455577.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
"Well, starting with the issue of political uncertainty and investment, investment spending really has been quite weak for some time, and we’re really not certain exactly what is causing that.",1474455590.0,0.0,1474455650.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
" Part of it, of course, has been the huge contraction in drilling activity associated with falling oil prices, but the weakness in investment spending extends beyond—beyond that sector, and I’m not certain of exactly what explains that, whether—I’m not aware of evidence that suggests that it’s political uncertainty, but it certainly—I would agree with the finding that it has been weak.",1474455621.0,1.0,1474455681.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
 Consumer sentiment is perfectly solid.,1474455623.0,1.0,1474455683.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
" We’re seeing a lot of strength in consumer spending, and consumer sentiment certainly seems to be solid.",1474455632.0,1.0,1474455692.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
You asked about scope for further monetary policy action.,1474455638.0,1.0,1474455698.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
 I was careful in Jackson Hole.,1474455642.0,1.0,1474455702.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
 I indicated we have a number of tools that we’ve used before and could use again.,1474455649.0,0.0,1474455709.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
 I did indicate that I do have concerns about the scope for monetary policy.,1474455656.0,0.0,1474455716.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
 And I mentioned specifically automatic stabilizers because I think that’s an important way in which fiscal policy serves to cushion shocks to the economy.,1474455709.0,0.0,1474455769.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"So we are very focused on evaluating, given the way the economy is operating, what is the right policy to foster our goals, and I’m not going to get into politics.",1474455782.0,0.0,1474455842.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
" I’m just—those are factors that we don’t consider, and I don’t—I’m not going to get involved in commenting on the election.",1474455791.0,0.0,1474455851.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
"In terms of the dissents, as I indicated, the notion that we do have some accommodation, that if we continue on the current path, it’s something we will need to remove over time.",1474455808.0,0.0,1474455868.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
" There’s general agreement among participants on that, but the precise timing of what is the right—what is the right timing for removing that accommodation is something on which we had active discussions, and there are a range of opinions.",1474455827.0,0.0,1474455887.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
 And the dissents represent a judgment on the part of some of my colleagues that it’s important to begin that process now.,1474455838.0,0.0,1474455898.0,2.0,2.0,4.0
"I certainly agree, and I’ve said myself, that there are risks in waiting too long to remove accommodation, and we need to take a forward-looking approach.",1474455853.0,1.0,1474455913.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
 I’ve always advocated making policy based on forecasts of where the economy is heading and taking account of risks.,1474455864.0,1.0,1474455924.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
 And there are two particular risks that we need to think about and balance.,1474455869.0,1.0,1474455929.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
"One is the risk that the economy runs too hot, that unemploy—the labor market tightens too much, that unemployment falls to a very low level, that we need to tighten policy in a less gradual way than would be ideal, and in the course of doing that, because that is a very difficult thing to accomplish, to gently create a bit more slack in the labor market, we could cause a recession in the process.",1474455901.0,2.0,1474455961.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
 And so that’s something my colleagues and I certainly wouldn’t want to be responsible for.,1474455907.0,2.0,1474455967.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
"On the other hand, inflation is running below our 2 percent objective, and it’s also important that we make sure we get back to 2 percent.",1474455941.0,2.0,1474456001.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
" And I have routinely indicated a number of measures of inflation expectations that are running at the low ends of their historical range, and we’re watching that as well.",1474455953.0,2.0,1474456013.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
 And there would also be risks from not seeing inflation move back to our 2 percent objective.,1474455960.0,1.0,1474456020.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" I think the public, if they had been watching our meeting on TV today, would have felt that we had a rich, deep, serious, intellectual debate about the risks and the forecasts for the economy, and we struggled mightily with trying to understand one another’s points of view and to come out at a balanced place and to act responsibly.",1474456044.0,0.0,1474456104.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
" We—I—it is important that we maintain the confidence of the public, and I do believe that we deserve it.",1474456102.0,0.0,1474456162.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
" Of course, we—we are worried that bubbles could form in the economy, and we routinely monitor asset valuations.",1474456138.0,0.0,1474456198.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"And we are—we are, in our supervision with banks, as I indicated, we have issued supervisory guidance to make sure that underwriting standards are sound on these loans, and we’re aware—this is something also that we look at in stress tests of the large—the larger banks to see what would happen to their capital positions and to make sure that they hold sufficient capital.",1474456203.0,0.0,1474456263.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
"So, in this specific case, the abuses that occurred took place in a national bank.",1474456264.0,1.0,1474456324.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
 The Comptroller of the Currency has responsibility there.,1474456267.0,1.0,1474456327.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" So, you know, that’s a political issue that’s currently being debated that I really don’t want to get into.",1474456385.0,2.0,1474456445.0,4.0,2.0,4.0
So we have high expectations for what we expect to be in place in a large organization or in any banking organization.,1474456443.0,4.0,1474456503.0,3.0,-1.0,2.0
"So the projections—I agree, the projections for growth are slow.",1474456587.0,6.0,1474456647.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
 We have further written down our estimate of the longer-run normal growth rate.,1474456595.0,6.0,1474456655.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"Now, why we would never—and slow growth is a factor.",1474456623.0,6.0,1474456683.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
" Slow productivity growth is a factor that influences the longer-run normal level of interest rates, and writing down the likely pace of productivity growth is one factor that is responsible for the downward shift in the path that you see for the federal funds rate.",1474456647.0,6.0,1474456707.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
 That’s an important reason for revising down the neutral rate.,1474456651.0,6.0,1474456711.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"But now, let’s go to your—the part of your question about inflation.",1474456655.0,6.0,1474456715.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
 And the sad fact is that we are getting that healthy pace of job market growth with very slow growth in output.,1474456717.0,7.0,1474456777.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
  So this is—I don’t think it bears on the inflation outlook.,1474456722.0,6.0,1474456782.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
" It has prompted a downward shift in the projected path for the neutral and actual federal funds rate, but it is a huge concern because slow productivity growth ultimately means slow growth in living standards.",1474456739.0,6.0,1474456799.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
" Of course, consumer issues and issues that involve harm of consumers can become safety and soundness issues.",1474456796.0,7.0,1474456856.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" And if there was—at least one of the lessons from the financial crisis, I think, is that abuses of consumers of the sort that we see—saw in subprime lending ultimately did become—become safety and soundness issues.",1474456815.0,7.0,1474456875.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
So we have a system that Congress did set up in the Federal Reserve Act in which the governance of the Reserve Banks involves banks contributing capital and serving on the boards of directors.,1474456873.0,7.0,1474456933.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" And we have put in place very strong measures to ensure that those conflicts of interest are not allowed to play out in any—in any way, that bankers are not allowed to be involved in supervision.",1474456903.0,7.0,1474456963.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" Now, that setup—if that setup is changed, it raises which—it’s up to Congress to decide what to do here.",1474456948.0,7.0,1474457008.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"So I think the notion that monetary policy operates with long and variable lags—that statement is due to Milton Friedman, and it is one of the essential things to understand about monetary policy, and it has not fundamentally changed at all.",1474457026.0,7.0,1474457086.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
 We need to operate based on forecasts.,1474457040.0,7.0,1474457100.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
But the global economy and the U.S. economy have changed a lot.,1474457045.0,7.0,1474457105.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
 History doesn’t always exactly replay itself.,1474457050.0,7.0,1474457110.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
 And absolutely none of us want to relive an episode like that.,1474457086.0,7.0,1474457146.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" And so I believe, and my colleagues, that it is important to be forward looking.",1474457093.0,7.0,1474457153.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
 We’re not going to make that mistake again.,1474457096.0,7.0,1474457156.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"But the structure of the economy changes, things do change.",1474457099.0,7.0,1474457159.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" The nature of the inflation process has changed, I think, significantly since the bad days of the ’70s when the Fed had to face this chronic high-inflation problem.",1474457112.0,7.0,1474457172.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" We’ve seen inflation respond less to the economy, to movements in the unemployment rate—that’s sometimes said, “The Phillips curve has become flatter.",1474457123.0,7.0,1474457183.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
" But there always a remi—should be a reminder to us that we also would not want to find ourselves in a period where inflation is chronically low—running below our objective, inflation expectations are slipping.",1474457187.0,6.0,1474457247.0,5.0,-1.0,2.0
