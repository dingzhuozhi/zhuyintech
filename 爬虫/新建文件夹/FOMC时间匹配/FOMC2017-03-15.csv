" But it’s also a question of not only the current level, but our confidence in the outlook and our projections for the future path of the federal funds rate.",1497437146.0,7.0,1497437206.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
 So we have increased our federal funds rate target now several times.,1497437149.0,7.0,1497437209.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
 I have not had conversations with the President about future plans.,1497437219.0,7.0,1497437279.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"So let me just say, as I emphasized in my statement and always say, monetory policy is not on a preset course.",1497437295.0,7.0,1497437355.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" We indicated in our statement today that we’re closely monitoring inflation developments and certainly have taken note of the fact that there have been several weak readings, particularly on core inflation.",1497437317.0,7.0,1497437377.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
 Our statement indicates that we expect inflation to remain low in the near term.,1497437320.0,7.0,1497437380.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
" But, on the other hand, we continue to feel that with a strong labor market and a labor market that’s continuing to strengthen, the conditions are in place for inflation to move up.",1497437338.0,7.0,1497437398.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
" Now, obviously we need to monitor that very carefully and ensure, especially with roughly five years of inflation running under our 2 percent objective— that is a goal to which the committee is strongly committed.",1497437366.0,7.0,1497437426.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
" And we need to make sure that we have in place the policies that are necessary to achieve 2 percent inflation, and I pledge that we will do that.",1497437368.0,7.0,1497437428.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
" As I pointed out, there have been some idiosyncratic factors I think that have held down inflation in recent months, particularly a huge decline in cell telephone service plan prices, some declines in prescription drugs.",1497437412.0,6.0,1497437472.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
" We had an exceptionally low reading on core PCE in March, and that will continue to hold down 12-month changes until that reading drops out.",1497437421.0,6.0,1497437481.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
" But we are—this morning’s reading on the CPI showed weakness in a number of categories, and it’s certainly something that we will be closely monitoring in the months ahead.",1497437440.0,6.0,1497437500.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"Well, we are closely looking at the actual performance of inflation and altering our views on the basis of discrepancies between what we see and our expectations.",1497437587.0,6.0,1497437647.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
" Now, in the face of very low unemployment that we have seen, while wage growth has picked up somewhat, it remains low, and inflation is influenced by a number of different factors, but we certainly haven’t seen much or any evident upward pressure on inflation.",1497437647.0,6.0,1497437707.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"So I would say that business and household sentiment remains quite strong, although many forecasters have pushed back somewhat the timing of the expected policy changes, such as changes to tax policy or fiscal policy more generally.",1497437728.0,6.0,1497437788.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
" I would say that, based on my observation of actual spending behavior and my discussions with our wide range of contacts, that I haven’t seen very much evidence that, thus far, expectations of policy changes have driven substantial changes in either consumer spending or investment spending.",1497437745.0,6.0,1497437805.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"Well, in deciding what the appropriate path of rates is, we take many different factors into account.",1497437797.0,6.0,1497437857.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
" We have done that, and—but other things also affect the stance of policy.",1497437845.0,6.0,1497437905.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
 So there really can’t be any simple relationship.,1497437846.0,6.0,1497437906.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
 We’re not targeting financial conditions.,1497437848.0,6.0,1497437908.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
So I don’t think central bank credibility—at least the Fed’s credibility—has been impaired.,1497437916.0,6.0,1497437976.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
 We look at a whole variety of indicators of inflation expectations.,1497437921.0,6.0,1497437981.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
 They embody other elements—risk premia and liquidity premia as well.,1497437963.0,6.0,1497438023.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
" They had moved down and now have moved—they remain at low levels, but they have moved back up again.",1497437972.0,6.0,1497438032.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
" It is true that some household surveys of inflation expectations have moved down, but overall I wouldn’t say that we’ve seen a broad undermining of inflation expectations.",1497437993.0,6.0,1497438053.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"But you asked also, I guess, about have structural changes perhaps impacted the inflation process, and that certainly is possible.",1497438005.0,6.0,1497438065.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
 And estimates of the normal longer-run unemployment rate—they are quite uncertain.,1497438007.0,6.0,1497438067.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
 I agree with your assessment there.,1497438008.0,6.0,1497438068.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
 We’re really not certain what they are.,1497438009.0,6.0,1497438069.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
 And policy is not being—is not based on some firmly held preconceived notion.,1497438020.0,6.0,1497438080.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
We’re watching very carefully how the actual economy performs.,1497438023.0,6.0,1497438083.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
" And, you know, I continue to believe, though, that with job growth running well in excess, even with the moderation of the level that’s needed to provide for new entrants in the labor market, we do have a strengthening economy.",1497438063.0,6.0,1497438123.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
" With policy accommodative, all that we’re doing in raising rates is moving— removing a bit of accommodation heading toward a neutral pace.",1497438068.0,6.0,1497438128.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
 And I see that as appropriate.,1497438070.0,6.0,1497438130.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
 We’re not moving so aggressively as to put a brake on continued improvement in the labor market.,1497438080.0,6.0,1497438140.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
" But I think that that’s a prudent move, to move in a gradual way to remove accommodation, with unemployment now—and not only, I should say, the unemployment rate, but I think any indicator of labor market performance and tightness that you could look at, whether it’s household perceptions of the availability of jobs, difficulty that firms report in hiring workers, the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs, the rate of job openings, all of these indicators do signal a tight labor market.",1497438124.0,6.0,1497438184.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"Now, with inflation below 2 percent, I think it’s appropriate that the labor market be that tight.",1497438125.0,6.0,1497438185.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
" So moving to some extent in a timely way to remove accommodation with a strong economy and continued labor market strength, the Committee believes, is an appropriate management of risks.",1497438169.0,6.0,1497438229.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"2 percent objective, that we’ve faced that situation now for a long time, and it’s really quite essential that we put in place policies that will succeed in moving inflation back to our 2 percent objective, and it’s a symmetric objective.",1497438189.0,6.0,1497438249.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"So, at the time that we adopted the 2 percent target—it was back in 2012—we had a very thorough discussion of the factors that should determine what our inflation objective should be.",1497438252.0,6.0,1497438312.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
" And, you know, I believe that was a well-thought-out decision.",1497438255.0,6.0,1497438315.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
" Now, at the moment, we are highly focused on trying to achieve our 2 percent objective.",1497438260.0,6.0,1497438320.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
" And we recognize the fact that inflation has been running below, and it’s essential for us to move inflation back to that objective.",1497438271.0,6.0,1497438331.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"Now, we’ve learned a lot in the meantime, and assessments of the level of the neutral likely level, currently and going forward, of the neutral federal funds rate have changed and are quite a bit lower than they stood in 2012 or earlier years.",1497438306.0,5.0,1497438366.0,4.0,-1.0,2.0
 And that means that the economy is— has the potential where policy could be constrained by the zero lower bound more frequently than at the time that we adopted our 2 percent objective.,1497438314.0,6.0,1497438374.0,4.0,-2.0,1.0
 And it’s important for our decisions to be informed by a wide range of views and research which is ongoing inside and outside the Fed.,1497438355.0,5.0,1497438415.0,2.0,-3.0,1.0
"  But a reconsideration of that objective needs to take account not only of benefits of a higher in—potential benefits of a higher inflation target, but also the potential costs that could be associated with it.",1497438363.0,4.0,1497438423.0,2.0,-2.0,1.0
  It needs to be a balanced assessment.,1497438373.0,4.0,1497438433.0,2.0,-2.0,1.0
"So let me first say, it’s not straightforward to determine exactly what expectations are embodied in market prices because there are term premia that affect these rates, and they may not really be as low as one would infer from a straight read.",1497438453.0,2.0,1497438513.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" That said, in part, expectations reflect estimates of what the neutral federal funds rate is and how it’s likely to evolve over time.",1497438462.0,2.0,1497438522.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" And views have changed about that over time, and there is a good deal of uncertainty about it.",1497438466.0,2.0,1497438526.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" So we have recently put out charts that try to show what the range of uncertainty is around our path for the federal funds rate, especially as one goes further out.",1497438488.0,2.0,1497438548.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
"There’s a good deal of uncertainty and—that reflects the, like—all the shocks that can affect the evolution of the economy, and also the fact, we’re quite uncertain ourselves about what the likely—what the evolution will be of the neutral federal funds rate.",1497438506.0,2.0,1497438566.0,3.0,1.0,3.0
So we do try to write that down and provide the public with information about our current expectations.,1497438508.0,2.0,1497438568.0,3.0,1.0,3.0
" And the median now stands at around 3 percent, but we have uncertainty about that.",1497438512.0,2.0,1497438572.0,3.0,1.0,3.0
  Many of my colleagues and I think that the current neutral level is lower than that.,1497438517.0,2.0,1497438577.0,3.0,1.0,3.0
" And it’s important that the market take an independent look, and that we get to understand and see how market participants are interpreting evidence on the evolution of the economy.",1497438591.0,3.0,1497438651.0,3.0,0.0,0.0
"So we have indicated for quite some time, I guess, since our—at least since our 2014 normalization principles, that we wanted to reduce our balance sheet in a gradual and predictable way.",1497438681.0,4.0,1497438741.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
 And we have tried systematically to communicate more about how we would do that as our plans have evolved.,1497438684.0,4.0,1497438744.0,5.0,1.0,3.0
"  And today’s announcement is another step in providing further details about how we plan to proceed so that when this plan does go into effect, no one is taken by surprise and market participants understand how this will work.",1497438716.0,4.0,1497438776.0,5.0,1.0,3.0
" My hope and expectation is that when we decide to go forward with this plan, that there will be very little reaction to it, that it’s clear how we intend to proceed, and that this is something that will just run quietly in the background over a number of years, leading to a reduction in the size of our balance sheet and in the outstanding stock of reserves, and that it’s something that the Committee will not be reconsidering from time to time.",1497438773.0,5.0,1497438833.0,4.0,-1.0,2.0
"Well, with respect to the impact of credit conditions and bank regulation on slow growth, I’ve previously, in testifying, indicated that I don’t think that our regulations have played an important role, at least broadly speaking, in impeding credit growth and the growth of the economy.",1497438880.0,4.0,1497438940.0,3.0,-1.0,2.0
" And I’ve pointed in the past to a number of statistics suggesting that credit growth continues to be healthy, including among small—smaller community banks that are most concerned with regulatory burden.",1497438886.0,4.0,1497438946.0,3.0,-1.0,2.0
" I think when banks are undercapitalized and weak, that impedes credit growth.",1497438886.0,4.0,1497438946.0,3.0,-1.0,2.0
" And when banks are strong, they’re in a much better position to lend.",1497438887.0,4.0,1497438947.0,3.0,-1.0,2.0
 So that’s been a view that I’ve stated previously.,1497438896.0,4.0,1497438956.0,3.0,-1.0,2.0
"Now, in terms of regulation, the Treasury recently issued, on Monday, a detailed report.",1497438907.0,4.0,1497438967.0,3.0,-1.0,2.0
 And that’s quite a complicated document with lots of recommendations in it.,1497438910.0,3.0,1497438970.0,3.0,0.0,0.0
" I haven’t had a chance to review it thoroughly, so I don’t want to comment on too many details.",1497438920.0,3.0,1497438980.0,2.0,-1.0,2.0
"  Regulatory burden, when it’s possible to ease it, and a good deal of the Treasury report is focused on regulatory burden, that’s something that all regulators should be looking to do.",1497438965.0,3.0,1497439025.0,2.0,-1.0,2.0
" We strongly believe in the importance of tailoring our regulation to the size and complexity of institutions, of finding ways to relieve burden for community banks.",1497438979.0,2.0,1497439039.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" There is probably some areas where we’re likely to have differences but quite—you know, quite a number of areas where we’re, you know, likely to be able to and already are taking actions that are consistent with those recommendations.",1497439028.0,2.0,1497439088.0,3.0,1.0,3.0
"Well, I have felt that it’s been appropriate for interest rates to remain low for a very long time.",1497439028.0,2.0,1497439088.0,3.0,1.0,3.0
" We are in the process of, as the economy strengthens, normalizing interest rates.",1497439038.0,2.0,1497439098.0,3.0,1.0,3.0
" But, certainly, we’ve had a lot of years in which interest rates have been low.",1497439038.0,2.0,1497439098.0,3.0,1.0,3.0
" And, you know, as the statement says, we’ve made no definite decision on the timing of the plan, but—the timing of initiating the plan.",1497439131.0,3.0,1497439191.0,2.0,-1.0,2.0
"  But if the economy evolves in line with our expectations, which, you know, we will be watching—always are—we could put this into effect relatively soon.",1497439145.0,2.0,1497439205.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
"So we have previously suggested exempting community banks, smaller banks, entirely from the rule.",1497439209.0,1.0,1497439269.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
 And a number of my colleagues have spoken about the Volcker rule.,1497439214.0,1.0,1497439274.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" Implementation of it is frankly complex, and I’m certainly open to looking at ways to reduce regulatory burden in that area.",1497439243.0,1.0,1497439303.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
 The report endorses a restriction on proprietary trading.,1497439247.0,1.0,1497439307.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" So, in that sense, it endorses the main objective of the Volcker rule, which I was pleased to see.",1497439251.0,1.0,1497439311.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
 We’ve done an awful lot of rule writing over the last five or six years.,1497439315.0,1.0,1497439375.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"Well, thanks.",1497439374.0,1.0,1497439434.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
 That’s a great question.,1497439377.0,1.0,1497439437.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
" I mean, staff in the Federal Reserve and outside economists have done a great deal of work trying to evaluate QE.",1497439397.0,1.0,1497439457.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
" I think the general conclusion is that it has worked in that it has put some downward pressure on longer- term interest rates, so-called term premiums embedded in longer-term interest rates.",1497439416.0,1.0,1497439476.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
" There’s disagreement among economists about exactly how large those effects are, and it’s something that’s difficult to pin down.",1497439423.0,1.0,1497439483.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0

" It’s something that, if we were to encounter an episode in the future of extreme weakness where—I’ve said we want the fed funds rate and movements in short-term interest rates, that’s our go-to number one main policy tool— but if we were to hit the zero lower bound and constrained in our use of that tool, certainly balance sheet policies and forward guidance of the type that we provided, I believe, based on the evidence of how they worked, ought to remain part of our toolkit.",1497439518.0,0.0,1497439578.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
