" For this year, there was a slight upward revision to inflation, and some of the participants, but not all of the participants, did incorporate some assumption of a change in fiscal policy into their projections.",1481711998.0,7.0,1481712058.0,7.0,0.0,0.0

" I don’t think there’s anything that I could say in general about what tax policy would do, but that—and I really can’t tell you what the Fed’s response would be to any policy changes that are put into effect.",1481712126.0,7.0,1481712186.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" I—you know, it’s something I really just can’t generalize about because, while it would be desirable to have tax policies that do increase the productive capacity of the economy, an increase in the pace of productivity change is one of the factors that does affect the economy’s neutral rate.",1481712171.0,7.0,1481712231.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
 A boost to productivity could spur investment.,1481712174.0,7.0,1481712234.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
So let me say that our decision to raise rates is—should certainly be understood as a reflection of the confidence we have in the progress the economy has made and our judgment that that progress will continue.,1481712237.0,7.0,1481712297.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
 And the economy has proven to be remarkably resilient.,1481712242.0,7.0,1481712302.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" It could boost very slightly some short-term interest rates that could have an effect on borrowing costs that are linked to them, but, overall, I think that households and firms will see very modest changes from this decision.",1481712280.0,7.0,1481712340.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
 The degree of accommodation I would characterize as moderate.,1481712351.0,7.0,1481712411.0,7.0,0.0,0.0

 So there is some accommodation.,1481712364.0,7.0,1481712424.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
 Remember that inflation is still below our objective.,1481712370.0,7.0,1481712430.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
 The Committee projects—at least the median projection shows a very modest undershoot of estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.,1481712383.0,7.0,1481712443.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" The median unemployment rate here gets down to 4½ percent, which is just a few tenths below the estimated longer-run normal level of the unemployment rate.",1481712395.0,7.0,1481712455.0,7.0,0.0,0.0

" So, with a 4.6 percent unemployment and a solid labor market, there may be some additional slack in labor markets, but I would judge that the degree of slack has diminished.",1481712525.0,7.0,1481712585.0,7.0,0.0,0.0

 That’s an appropriate policy purely on the grounds that inflation is running below our objective.,1481712733.0,7.0,1481712793.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"  And while we don’t want to overshoot our 2 percent objective, we also don’t want a persistent undershoot of our 2 percent objective, and that does involve a labor market that may succeed in attracting more people off the sidelines into the labor market.",1481712754.0,7.0,1481712814.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
 It’s something we will see as we examine experience over the next couple of years.,1481712761.0,7.0,1481712821.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
 We may adjust our views on this.,1481712763.0,7.0,1481712823.0,7.0,0.0,0.0

 Yes.,1481712894.0,7.0,1481712954.0,7.0,0.0,0.0

"I think it’s very important that we have reduced the odds that a systemically important firm could fail by requiring higher capital, higher liquidity, by performing stress tests that provide us another way of ensuring that the firms we count on to supply credit to households and businesses would be able to go on doing that even in the face of a severely adverse shock.",1481712971.0,7.0,1481713031.0,7.0,0.0,0.0

 I would simply summarize by saying that all the FOMC participants recognize that there is considerable uncertainty about how economic policies may change and what effect they will have on the economy.,1481713170.0,7.0,1481713230.0,3.0,-4.0,1.0

" The changes—the financial market changes that you described, particularly the increase in stock prices, the increase in longer-term rates, and the strengthening of the dollar, suggest that many market participants anticipate expansionary fiscal policies that would raise interest rates somewhat in the United States relative to abroad and would cause a strengthening in the dollar.",1481713250.0,2.0,1481713310.0,5.0,3.0,4.0

" One of the things we’ve learned from our financial crisis and from a series of financial crises in history and around the globe is that, very commonly, when the economy takes a hit and falls into a recession, that productivity doesn’t pick up to pre-recession levels and that there looks like there is a permanent hit to the path of potential output for the economy, which is called “hysteresis.",1481713749.0,4.0,1481713809.0,2.0,-2.0,1.0
