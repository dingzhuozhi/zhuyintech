" As I mentioned, we think our policy stance is appropriate at the moment, and we don’t see a strong case for moving in either direction.",1556707052.0,3.0,1556707112.0,2.0,-1.0,2.0
" And in this case, as we look at these readings in the first quarter for core, we do see good reasons to think that some or all of the unexpected decrease may wind up being transient.",1556707103.0,2.0,1556707163.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
" And I’d point to things like portfolio management, service prices, apparel prices, and other things.",1556707103.0,2.0,1556707163.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
"So as I mentioned, we’ve just come through a two-day meeting, and we’ve done a deep dive on economic and financial conditions in the United States and around the world and thought about our policy, and we do think our policy stance is appropriate right now.",1556707174.0,1.0,1556707234.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
 We don’t see a strong case for moving in either direction.,1556707180.0,1.0,1556707240.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
"So a small, temporary deviation outside of the range would really carry no—wouldn’t be important, as your question suggests.",1556707254.0,0.0,1556707314.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
 But we do think it’s important that we be able to control the federal funds rate and generally keep it within the range.,1556707256.0,0.0,1556707316.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
 And the transmission of the federal funds rate into other short-term rates—money market rates—has been very good over a long period of time.,1556707303.0,0.0,1556707363.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
" And that’s important, because it’s really broader financial conditions that matter, not so much precisely the federal funds rate.",1556707307.0,0.0,1556707367.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
We actually have a financial stability briefing and opportunity for comment every other meeting.,1556707363.0,0.0,1556707423.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
" So we had our quarterly briefing today—yesterday, as a matter of fact—and had that discussion as well.",1556707373.0,0.0,1556707433.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
" And I think there haven’t been a lot of changes since the last meeting, but I’ll just go through the way we think about it.",1556707376.0,0.0,1556707436.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
" First, we’ve developed and published our framework for assessing financial stability vulnerabilities—put it out for comment and welcome any feedback that we get from the public.",1556707388.0,0.0,1556707448.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
 And that enables us to focus our assessments regularly on the same things so that we can be held accountable and be transparent.,1556707396.0,1.0,1556707456.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"So there are four aspects of it that I’ll go through quickly, but I’d say that the headline really is that while there are some concerns around nonfinancial corporate debt, really the finding is that, overall, financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate, on balance.",1556707424.0,1.0,1556707484.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
" And, in addition, I would say that the financial system is quite resilient to shocks of various kinds with high capital and liquidity.",1556707427.0,1.0,1556707487.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
" But the four things we look at are, first, asset prices.",1556707430.0,1.0,1556707490.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
" And as for asset prices, some asset prices are somewhat elevated, but I would say not extremely so.",1556707433.0,1.0,1556707493.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
 Default rates are low.,1556707436.0,1.0,1556707496.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
"So, to your first question, if you go back and think about the middle of last year, inflation was at 2 percent and appeared to be staying there.",1556707566.0,0.0,1556707626.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
 And the economy was quite strong and was growing strong.,1556707572.0,0.0,1556707632.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
 The fiscal changes were hitting the economy in a very positive way.,1556707573.0,0.0,1556707633.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
 And so I think the expectation was that inflation would remain up around 2 percent.,1556707580.0,1.0,1556707640.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" The weak first quarter performance was not expected—of core was not expected, and I don’t think is related to anything we did, in terms of raising rates.",1556707594.0,1.0,1556707654.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" If inflation were to run persistently below 2 percent or persistently above 2 percent, that would be a concern for the Committee, and the Committee would take that into account in making policy.",1556707645.0,1.0,1556707705.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
 I do think it’s important that inflation run close to and sustainably —for a sustained period of time—and symmetrically around 2 percent.,1556707654.0,1.0,1556707714.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
" So probably the biggest single factor driving it is the rate of underlying inflation or the closely related idea of where inflation expectations are anchored—the thought being, that’s where inflation will go in the long run if it’s not been pushed by those other factors.",1556707736.0,2.0,1556707796.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
 So we also think that slack—the level of slack in the economy does play some small role.,1556707737.0,2.0,1556707797.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
 It’s actually still a measurable role.,1556707740.0,2.0,1556707800.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
" It’s nothing like it was in the 1960s when the Phillips curve was quite steep, so that’s also something that plays a role.",1556707747.0,2.0,1556707807.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
"So I think we’re getting in here to commenting on a nominee to the Fed indirectly, and that’s something I’d rather avoid.",1556707844.0,2.0,1556707904.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" I want to say it was April 1, but it may have been April 2.",1556707884.0,1.0,1556707944.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
" In any case, the Fedwire® did go down for a few hours, in the three- or four-hour range.",1556707895.0,2.0,1556707955.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" We were able to quickly identify the problem: It was an internal problem, and we were able to correct it and make changes so that that problem and other problems like it cannot repeat themselves.",1556707904.0,2.0,1556707964.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
"You know, I wouldn’t want to speculate.",1556707946.0,2.0,1556708006.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" There’s always the example of Australia that everyone, I think, is aware of, where I think they’re in year 28 of their expansion.",1556707955.0,2.0,1556708015.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
 So things are possible.,1556707958.0,2.0,1556708018.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
Similarities in the length.,1556708006.0,2.0,1556708066.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" I mean, the situations were quite different then.",1556708006.0,2.0,1556708066.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" This was before inflation really was under control, but, you know, it’s very interesting to look at the history.",1556708017.0,2.0,1556708077.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
 I find it quite interesting to look at different periods.,1556708021.0,2.0,1556708081.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
"Yes, so, as you know, we are a nonpolitical institution, and that means we don’t think about short-term political considerations, we don’t discuss them, and we don’t consider them in making our decisions one way or the other.",1556708086.0,2.0,1556708146.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" And what we’re always solving for in our process, in our work, is to carry out our mission, which is to extend the economic expansion, keep the labor market strong, and get inflation around 2 percent.",1556708097.0,2.0,1556708157.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" And in this particular case, we came to a unanimous decision, after an extensive discussion, that our monetary policy stance is appropriate where it is.",1556708157.0,2.0,1556708217.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" And we think our monetary policy stance is in a good place, and we’re going to be patient as we consider adjustments.",1556708158.0,2.0,1556708218.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" And we also see, by the way, the evolving-risk picture as very consistent with that outlook.",1556708164.0,2.0,1556708224.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
So we don’t feel like the data’s pushing us in either direction.,1556708166.0,1.0,1556708226.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
 That’s how we think about things.,1556708173.0,2.0,1556708233.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" So you’re pointing to, really, the fact that in recent years inflation has moved down and down, and, really, many major central banks have struggled to reach their inflation goals from below.",1556708231.0,2.0,1556708291.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
"This is the ISM reading, I guess from this morning, on manufacturing.",1556708338.0,2.0,1556708398.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
 Manufacturing has been weak all around the world.,1556708356.0,2.0,1556708416.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
 Services have been growing faster.,1556708356.0,2.0,1556708416.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
"Our outlook and my outlook is for—is a positive one, is a healthy one for the U.",1556708403.0,1.0,1556708463.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
S. economy for growth for the rest of this year.,1556708407.0,1.0,1556708467.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" And I would say that the basis for that, really, is consumer spending and business investment.",1556708415.0,1.0,1556708475.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
 All those things are going to support consumer spending.,1556708443.0,1.0,1556708503.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"In terms of the effect of trade deals, I think one thing would be that the resolution of the uncertainty around these trade negotiations would, I would guess, be a positive for business sentiment.",1556708473.0,1.0,1556708533.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" We have been hearing from our business contacts, really, a lot since the beginning of the trade negotiations that uncertainty is a concern.",1556708475.0,1.0,1556708535.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" If you import metals or whatever for your product or export your product, then it’s been a challenge for you.",1556708479.0,1.0,1556708539.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
 So that would be a positive.,1556708483.0,1.0,1556708543.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" And, of course, most of the gains, though, I would expect, even from a successful trade negotiation, would come in over time.",1556708493.0,1.0,1556708553.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" You know, I don’t think—it wouldn’t be the kind of thing where you’d immediately feel big effects right away, but they could be quite important over a longer period.",1556708499.0,1.0,1556708559.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" Let me say, I don’t mean to diminish concerns about too-low inflation, but I think there’s good reason to think that these readings are particularly influenced by some transitory factors.",1556708551.0,1.0,1556708611.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
"One that I would mention is portfolio management services, which would tend to go down when asset prices go down, with a lag.",1556708553.0,1.0,1556708613.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
" And so when asset prices went back up, probably there’ll be a swing around there, a positive contribution.",1556708560.0,1.0,1556708620.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
" Other ones that get mentioned are things like apparel, and apparel prices were very, very low.",1556708561.0,1.0,1556708621.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
 There was a change in the methodology.,1556708565.0,1.0,1556708625.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
 And another one is airfares.,1556708568.0,1.0,1556708628.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
 There are many little things.,1556708568.0,1.0,1556708628.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
" So we don’t know until, again, until we see, but there’s reason to think that those would be transient and would turn around.",1556708580.0,1.0,1556708640.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
"Yes, it’s hard to say, because there’s so many other variables.",1556708681.0,0.0,1556708741.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
