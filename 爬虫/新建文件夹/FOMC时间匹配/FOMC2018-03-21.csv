"Well, let me start—let me start with the question of the Fed’s credibility, and you used the word “promises” in connection with that.",1458125156.0,0.0,1458125216.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"And, as I tried to emphasize in my opening statement, the paths that the participants project for the federal funds rate and how it will evolve are not a preset plan or commitment or promise of the Committee.",1458125178.0,0.0,1458125238.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
" Indeed, they are not even—the median should not be interpreted as a Committee-endorsed forecast, and there’s a lot of uncertainty around each participant’s projection.",1458125194.0,0.0,1458125254.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
And they will evolve—those assessments of appropriate policy are completely contingent on each participant’s forecast of the economy and how economic events will unfold.,1458125214.0,0.0,1458125274.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"And they are, of course, uncertain, and you should fully expect that forecasts for the appropriate path of policy on the part of all participants will evolve over time as shocks, positive or negative, hit the economy that alter those forecasts.",1458125236.0,0.0,1458125296.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
"So you have seen a shift this time in most participants’ assessments of the appropriate path for policy, and, as I tried to indicate, I think that largely reflects a somewhat slower projected path for global growth—for growth in the global economy outside the United States—and for some tightening in credit conditions in the form of an increase in spreads.",1458125268.0,0.0,1458125328.0,2.0,2.0,4.0
And those changes in financial conditions and in the path of the global economy have induced changes in the assessment of individual participants in what path is appropriate to achieve our objectives.,1458125287.0,1.0,1458125347.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
So that’s what you see. That’s what you see.,1458125291.0,1.0,1458125351.0,3.0,2.0,4.0
"Now, I guess you asked me also what would we need to see to continue raising rates, and I think it’s worth pointing out here that the Committee—most participants do continue to envision that if economic developments unfold as they expect, that further increases in the federal funds rate will prove appropriate over time.",1458125319.0,1.0,1458125379.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
"Most participants anticipate that, and that the pace will be gradual.",1458125326.0,2.0,1458125386.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
"As I emphasized, most empirical work attempting to assess what the equilibrium level of the fed funds rate is, a level that would be neither expansionary nor contractionary is—those assessments are quite low at this time.",1458125345.0,2.0,1458125405.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
"There may be some—you know, I want to warn that there may be some transitory factors that are influencing that.",1458125389.0,2.0,1458125449.0,3.0,1.0,3.0
"So I want to make clear that our inflation objective is 2 percent, and we are projecting a move back to 2 percent.",1458125452.0,3.0,1458125512.0,4.0,1.0,3.0
"And we are not trying to engineer an overshoot of inflation, not to compensate for past undershoots, so 2 percent is our objective.",1458125466.0,2.0,1458125526.0,5.0,3.0,4.0
"But it is a symmetric objective, and we certainly don’t seek to overshoot our objective.",1458125473.0,4.0,1458125533.0,5.0,1.0,3.0
"But some undershoots and overshoots are part of how the economy operates, and our tolerance for those is symmetric with respect to under- and overshoots.",1458125489.0,4.0,1458125549.0,5.0,1.0,3.0
We did take note in the statement of the fact that inflation has picked up in recent months.,1458125497.0,3.0,1458125557.0,3.0,0.0,0.0
"But we note—the Committee notes, as it did in December, that we continue to monitor development trends and developments closely, and that would include both the fact that recent inflation readings have been on the high side, and, as I mentioned, on the other side, that readings on measures of inflation compensation and some survey measures have been on the low side.",1458125560.0,3.0,1458125620.0,5.0,2.0,4.0
So there has been a slight downgrading of the assessment of economic growth for this year.,1458125609.0,5.0,1458125669.0,6.0,1.0,3.0
"But, nevertheless, growth is expected to run in—somewhat in excess of potential, so that the labor market is expected to continue to tighten, and by the end of the year, even edge below levels that—of the unemployment rate—that are estimated to be longer in the normal run, and inflation is expected to gradually move back to 2 percent over time.",1458125645.0,5.0,1458125705.0,6.0,1.0,3.0
"We still have, weighing on inflation, the influence of earlier declines in energy prices and a prolonged effect from the appreciation of the dollar, but we do expect those transitory influences to fade. ",1458125664.0,6.0,1458125724.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"As I indicated in December—the Committee indicated in December, we want inflation to go back to 2 percent.",1458125699.0,6.0,1458125759.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
"But we also want to be careful not to see some significant overshoots, so that we would get behind the curve and potentially be faced with a need to tighten in a very rapid fashion later in a way that could undermine the sustainability of the employment gains we have had.",1458125720.0,6.0,1458125780.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
"So there has been, by many forecasters, a slight downgrading of forecasts of global growth in—over the coming several years.",1458125765.0,7.0,1458125825.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"The IMF has slightly downgraded their forecasts, and other international agencies have as well.",1458125773.0,7.0,1458125833.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
Chinese growth hasn’t proven a great surprise.,1458125779.0,7.0,1458125839.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
" We’ve anticipated that it would slow over time, and it seems to be slowing as well.",1458125786.0,7.0,1458125846.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"Japanese growth in the fourth quarter was negative, and that was something of a surprise.",1458125797.0,7.0,1458125857.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"And with respect to the euro area, recent indicators suggest perhaps slightly weaker growth.",1458125805.0,7.0,1458125865.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
"So there’s been a number of emerging markets—as you know, we’re suffering under the weight of declines in oil prices that are affecting their economic activity.",1458125821.0,7.0,1458125881.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"And, as I indicated, I think that’s part of the reason, along with the associated increase we have seen in some spreads that are involved in—enter into corporate borrowing rates, and can affect investment decisions.",1458125863.0,6.0,1458125923.0,5.0,-1.0,2.0
It’s a reason to think that a slightly lower path for the federal funds rate will be appropriate to achieve our objectives.,1458125872.0,6.0,1458125932.0,5.0,-1.0,2.0
"April remains a live meeting, and we will be tracking incoming data.",1458125927.0,5.0,1458125987.0,5.0,0.0,0.0
"It’s a slightly shorter period. We have six weeks, but there will be additional data on the labor market and on various factors that pertain to inflation.",1458125940.0,4.0,1458126000.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
So let me start with the impact of oil prices on consumer spending. ,1458125997.0,4.0,1458126057.0,5.0,1.0,3.0
"I have to say, it’s very difficult when you look at patterns of consumer spending to—there are many factors that influence it, and to definitively say that lower oil prices have not boosted consumer spending, I’m not sure we can really arrive at that conclusion in any—in any rigorous way.",1458126018.0,4.0,1458126078.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
"The typical—the average household in the United States with oil prices where they are now is probably benefiting around $1,000 a year. ",1458126031.0,4.0,1458126091.0,5.0,1.0,3.0
"And some very detailed microdata that I’ve seen on household spending patterns suggest that there may be a link, as you would expect, from reduced bills—you know, reduced amounts that people pay at the pump to other spending, like eating out at—for restaurant meals and other things.",1458126056.0,5.0,1458126116.0,5.0,0.0,0.0
"But the aggregate data, I—you know, is not as strong as it—and spending is not as strong as it could be, given the decline.",1458126066.0,5.0,1458126126.0,6.0,1.0,3.0
"And, of course, on the other side, we are—and, you know, it may be that it will take a while, and it’s something that will slowly strengthen over time if oil prices stay low. ",1458126080.0,5.0,1458126140.0,4.0,-1.0,2.0
"On the other side, of course, we have seen a marked decline in drilling activity, which has depressed investment spending, and, of course, very substantial layoffs in the energy sector.",1458126094.0,6.0,1458126154.0,4.0,-2.0,1.0
"And when I say that, what I mean is that if oil prices move up during the time that it’s moving up, it raises inflation. ",1458126132.0,6.0,1458126192.0,5.0,-1.0,2.0
And that’s what you see in the forecasts of participants.,1458126175.0,4.0,1458126235.0,6.0,2.0,4.0
"So let me say that, in recent weeks, I think the Committee certainly thinks that risks to the outlook have diminished.",1458126247.0,6.0,1458126307.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"Nevertheless, we continue to see risks, which we highlighted.",1458126254.0,6.0,1458126314.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
" Now, I would point out that we decided not to describe the balance of risks as weighted to the downside.",1458126263.0,6.0,1458126323.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"So the Committee did not reach that judgment, and there is no collective judgment in this statement on whether the risks are balanced or not. ",1458126277.0,6.0,1458126337.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
My—we declined to make a collective assessment.,1458126281.0,6.0,1458126341.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"You know, my guess is that some participants see them as balanced, and some see them as weighted somewhat to the downside.",1458126290.0,6.0,1458126350.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
But I think it is important to note a couple of things.,1458126293.0,6.0,1458126353.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"A number of countries—including China, the euro area, the Bank of Japan—have taken measures to stimulate the economy, so there is also upside risk to the economic outlook.",1458126344.0,6.0,1458126404.0,5.0,-1.0,2.0
" And, in addition, oil prices have rebounded from their lows, and that eases concerns about the financial condition of some energy firms and the stresses facing some oil-producing economies.",1458126358.0,6.0,1458126418.0,5.0,-1.0,2.0
"And, at the same time, low oil prices continue to boost household purchasing power.",1458126363.0,6.0,1458126423.0,5.0,-1.0,2.0
So there are risks.,1458126366.0,6.0,1458126426.0,5.0,-1.0,2.0
We’re attentive to them.,1458126367.0,6.0,1458126427.0,5.0,-1.0,2.0
"So I must say I’m—I do see broad-based improvement in the labor market, and I’m somewhat surprised that we’re not seeing more of a pickup in wage growth.",1458126414.0,5.0,1458126474.0,6.0,1.0,3.0
"So I do think, consistent with the 2 percent inflation objective, that there is certainly scope for further increases in wages.",1458126463.0,6.0,1458126523.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"Let me start with your second question, if I might. So in trying to judge the outlook for the economy, we do look at measures pertaining to consumer sentiment, and they are in solid territory.",1458126534.0,7.0,1458126594.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
Household balance sheets are much improved.,1458126538.0,7.0,1458126598.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
Gains in inflation- adjusted disposable income are running at a healthy pace.,1458126545.0,7.0,1458126605.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
"As I mentioned, households have benefited pretty significantly from lower oil prices, and measures of consumer sentiment do reflect—do reflect that.",1458126560.0,7.0,1458126620.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
So they are not at low levels. ,1458126562.0,7.0,1458126622.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
"And, really, the labor market, I think, has improved a great deal.",1458126568.0,6.0,1458126628.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"And every demographic group that, you know, we track regularly has seen improvement in their labor market situation—perhaps not all equally, but almost all demographic groups have seen improvement. ",1458126586.0,7.0,1458126646.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
"That said, we know that inequality has been rising in the United States over many years, not just the last several but going back to the mid-’80s.",1458126606.0,6.0,1458126666.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"There has been downward pressure on real wage groups—on real wage gains for groups, particularly those that are less skilled and educated, and those longer-term trends that may be associated with a number of factors— technological change and globalization—have been a concern for many, many years, and that may be part of what you’re—we’re seeing expressed.",1458126641.0,6.0,1458126701.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
So let me start with the question pertaining to exchange rates.,1458126645.0,6.0,1458126705.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
We have global capital markets.,1458126709.0,7.0,1458126769.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
"In—in a world with highly integrated capital markets, monetary policy actions in any country have effects—spillovers to other countries. ",1458126725.0,7.0,1458126785.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"That’s true of our monetary policy, and it’s true of other countries’ monetary policies. ",1458126731.0,7.0,1458126791.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"In part, that shows up through movements in exchange rates, and those movements are a factor that any country needs to take into account in deciding what is the appropriate stance of monetary policy. ",1458126750.0,6.0,1458126810.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
So the fact that there are these linkages is an important factor in designing a monetary policy.,1458126759.0,6.0,1458126819.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
But it does not mean that monetary—U.S. monetary policy is somehow constrained in a way that makes it impossible for our monetary policy to diverge from policies abroad.,1458126775.0,7.0,1458126835.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
"There are many periods when monetary policies in different countries have moved in different directions, and, you know, the United States has been growing more strongly and had better success in the labor market than many other advanced countries.",1458126797.0,7.0,1458126857.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"And, at this point, it’s natural that there should be some divergence in our monetary policies.",1458126805.0,7.0,1458126865.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
Movements in exchange rates partly reflect that.,1458126809.0,7.0,1458126869.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"So I wouldn’t want to endorse the notion if, you know—that you’re suggesting, that our policy is in some way crippled by the fact that there are these interlinkages.",1458126821.0,7.0,1458126881.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
That’s simply how the global financial system works.,1458126824.0,7.0,1458126884.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"We—this is one reason we meet—meet frequently with other economic policymakers in other countries, exchange notes about how we see economic developments evolve, and try to keep one another apprised of economic developments and likely policy responses.",1458126848.0,7.0,1458126908.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
Your second question concerned the political contributions.,1458126855.0,7.0,1458126915.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"The political activities of Governors, participants, government employees are governed by the Hatch Act.",1458126903.0,7.0,1458126963.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"We are all subject to that, and the Hatch Act does allow campaign contributions to be made. ",1458126912.0,7.0,1458126972.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
It outlaws other forms of partisan activity.,1458126919.0,7.0,1458126979.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"And I would say, within that, so it is each—it’s up to each individual to decide what is appropriate, in their point of view.",1458126930.0,7.0,1458126990.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
So I—the path of rate increases maybe slightly reflects the modest decline in estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate.,1458126991.0,7.0,1458127051.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"With respect to the nomination for Vice Chair[man] [for] Supervision, that’s a question that I think you need to pose to the White House.",1458127126.0,6.0,1458127186.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"I, you know, would say that we are doing a very good job on supervision, and, you know, we are very focused on and devote a great deal of time to that issue.",1458127140.0,6.0,1458127200.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
So I feel a great deal has been done.,1458127185.0,6.0,1458127245.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
"We have been working at this for a number of years, and I believe we have made very substantial progress.",1458127196.0,6.0,1458127256.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
"We have a—much more capital, higher-quality capital, liquidity in the banking system.",1458127204.0,6.0,1458127264.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
"The stress tests—the stress-test methodology that we use routinely to evaluate the robustness of the capital positions and plans of the largest institutions constitutes a quantum leap in terms of, I think, the quality of the supervision we are providing, especially of the largest firms.",1458127239.0,6.0,1458127299.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
So we have finished writing most of the Dodd-Frank rules.,1458127244.0,7.0,1458127304.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"We are working very hard on “too big to fail,” which is of grave concern to the American people.",1458127253.0,7.0,1458127313.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"In addition to having a financial system that is more robust and less likely to experience a failure, we have also worked very hard, continue to work on making sure we have the ability to resolve a firm if it were to fail in spite—in spite of having more capital and liquidity. ",1458127275.0,7.0,1458127335.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"And there, too, I think, we have made very substantial progress.",1458127280.0,7.0,1458127340.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"And working with the FDIC, I think, potential techniques that could be used in the event of a failure of a significant financial institution, we have also made a lot of progress there.",1458127344.0,7.0,1458127404.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"Well, I think—I think it’s our job as we make these improvements to explain what we’re doing and to try to educate the public about what’s happened, and they may not understand how much has changed.",1458127409.0,7.0,1458127469.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"Okay, so that was a complicated question, and there—let me start with the Phillips curve.",1458127465.0,7.0,1458127525.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"So the Phillips curve posits that there is a relationship between the degree of slack in the labor market and inflation, and it is an empirical relationship that, while not absolutely tight, has been a consistent relationship over time, and I believe that relationship still holds.",1458127489.0,7.0,1458127549.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"The Phillips curve has become, according to most estimates, quite flat in the sense that movements in unemployment have only a modest impact on inflation, so we shouldn’t overblow how large that is.",1458127513.0,7.0,1458127573.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"In addition, the Phillips curve theory suggests that inflation expectations are also an important driver of actual wage- and price-setting decisions and inflation behavior, and I believe there’s also solid empirical evidence for that.",1458127534.0,7.0,1458127594.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"And it’s one of the reasons that I highlighted in my statement, and we continue to highlight in the FOMC statement, that we are tracking indicators of the inflation expectations that matter to wage and price setting.",1458127552.0,7.0,1458127612.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
We have survey measures.,1458127558.0,7.0,1458127618.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"We know that household measures, even when households are asked about longer- term inflation—at longer-term inflation, they tend to move in response to salient changes in prices that they see every day.",1458127578.0,7.0,1458127638.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"And so, it’s also—we monitor those closely and discuss them in the statement in paragraph one, but, again, there’s not a straight read on what’s happening to the expectations that influence wage and price setting.",1458127635.0,7.0,1458127695.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
Okay. So what I would like to make clear is that this is not actively a subject that we are considering or discussing.,1458127702.0,7.0,1458127762.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"And, as I indicated, if events continue to unfold in that way, we are likely to gradually raise rates over time.",1458127724.0,7.0,1458127784.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"Again, that’s not fixed in stone.",1458127727.0,7.0,1458127787.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
We’ll watch how the economy behaves.,1458127730.0,7.0,1458127790.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"We’re prepared to respond if things transpire differently, but we are not spending time actively debating and considering things we could do for additional accommodation and certainly not actively considering negative rates.",1458127751.0,7.0,1458127811.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
