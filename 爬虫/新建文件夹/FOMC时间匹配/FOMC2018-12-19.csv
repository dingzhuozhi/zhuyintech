"Well, Steve, I think you can see from the SEP projections that most participants continued to think that economic conditions will call for or make appropriate an increase in the federal funds rate by the end of this year.",1442486759.0,1.0,1442486819.0,3.0,2.0,4.0
" Four participants moved their projections into 2016 or later, but the great majority of participants continued to hold that view.",1442486762.0,2.0,1442486822.0,3.0,1.0,3.0
" And, of course, there will always be uncertainty.",1442486764.0,2.0,1442486824.0,3.0,1.0,3.0
 We can’t expect that uncertainty to be fully resolved.,1442486764.0,2.0,1442486824.0,3.0,1.0,3.0
" We’ve had some further developments—namely, lower oil prices and a further appreciation of the dollar—that have put some downward pressure in the near term on inflation.",1442486806.0,1.0,1442486866.0,3.0,2.0,4.0
" Now, we fully expect those further effects, like the earlier moves in the dollar and in oil prices, to be transitory.",1442486814.0,3.0,1442486874.0,3.0,0.0,0.0
" But there is a little bit of downward pressure on inflation, and we would like to see some further developments.",1442486824.0,3.0,1442486884.0,2.0,-1.0,2.0
 That certainly includes October.,1442486880.0,2.0,1442486940.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" As you know, and I’ve stressed previously, were we to decide to do that, we would call a press briefing, and you’ve participated in an exercise to make sure that you would know how to participate in that press briefing should it happen.",1442486901.0,2.0,1442486961.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
" Of course, we will watch incoming data to confirm our expectation that that will continue.",1442486941.0,2.0,1442487001.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
" And we, of course, will watch global financial and economic developments.",1442486944.0,2.0,1442487004.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
" I can’t give you a recipe for exactly what we’re looking to see, but, as we say, we want to see continued improvement in the labor market, and we would like to bolster our confidence that inflation will move back to 2 percent.",1442486961.0,1.0,1442487021.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"So, we have been receiving advice from a large number of economists and interested groups, and that’s of course appropriate, and we value hearing the opinions of many—you know, many different groups and individuals with different perspectives.",1442487037.0,0.0,1442487097.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
" As I said, although we are close to many participant’s [estimates] and the median estimate of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, at least my own judgment—and this has been true for a long time—is that there are additional margins of slack, particularly relating to very high levels of part-time involuntary employment and labor force participation, that suggest that, at least to some extent, the standard unemployment rate understates the degree of slack in the labor market.",1442487086.0,0.0,1442487146.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
 But we are getting closer.,1442487089.0,0.0,1442487149.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"So, your first question was, have we come closer or moved further away from our inflation goal.",1442487146.0,0.0,1442487206.0,3.0,3.0,4.0
" We’re, after all, way below our inflation target.",1442487178.0,1.0,1442487238.0,3.0,2.0,4.0
 But an important reason for that is that declines in import prices reflecting the appreciation of the dollar and declines in energy prices are holding down inflation well below our target and well below core inflation.,1442487199.0,1.0,1442487259.0,3.0,2.0,4.0
2 percent.,1442487202.0,2.0,1442487262.0,3.0,1.0,3.0
" Now, in the intermeeting period, we have seen some further appreciation of the dollar and some further downward pressure on energy prices, and that creates a bit of further drag on inflation that I would view as transitory—is very likely to be transitory.",1442487233.0,3.0,1442487293.0,3.0,0.0,0.0
" So I continue and the Committee continues to expect that inflation will move back to 2 percent, so this should be a small thing.",1442487239.0,3.0,1442487299.0,5.0,2.0,4.0
" And, in the meantime, the labor market has continued to improve, so a tighter labor market, a labor market moving toward full employment, is one that historically has generated upward pressure on inflation.",1442487252.0,3.0,1442487312.0,6.0,3.0,4.0
 So that bolsters my confidence in inflation.,1442487260.0,3.0,1442487320.0,5.0,2.0,4.0
" On the other hand, we’ve had a long period in which inflation has been running below our objective.",1442487262.0,3.0,1442487322.0,4.0,1.0,3.0
" I consider it, and the Committee does, very important that we—we achieve our inflation objective and defend against inflation that is persistently above our inflation objective and also persistently below our inflation objective.",1442487286.0,3.0,1442487346.0,4.0,1.0,3.0
" And we want to have not only an expectation, but a good degree of confidence that that will occur.",1442487293.0,3.0,1442487353.0,4.0,1.0,3.0
" And the labor market is really important that as it continues to improve—it has, and we want to see it improve further—that serves to bolster confidence.",1442487348.0,4.0,1442487408.0,5.0,1.0,3.0
"Oh, I’m sorry, you asked about the September 2012 leak.",1442487349.0,4.0,1442487409.0,5.0,1.0,3.0
" Well, we have been very focused, Binya, on doing everything we can to revive this economy and to achieve our maximum employment objective.",1442487428.0,5.0,1442487488.0,7.0,2.0,4.0
" And after we took the funds rate down to zero, as you know, we put in place a number of other extraordinary measures—including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases—in order to speed the recovery and attain both our inflation objective and our maximum employment objective.",1442487462.0,6.0,1442487522.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
" And, I mean, when you look at the projection, you see, as you mentioned, that we see sufficient growth to push the unemployment rate.",1442487464.0,6.0,1442487524.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
 It’s already very close to participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal level.,1442487466.0,6.0,1442487526.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
" We expect the unemployment rate to fall slightly—or, at least, participants project that it will fall slightly below that level.",1442487477.0,7.0,1442487537.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" As that occurs, we would expect labor force participation, the cyclical component of that, to diminish over time, and we would hope to see some decline in the portion of slack that’s reflected in high levels of part-time involuntary employment.",1442487503.0,6.0,1442487563.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
"Now, inflation is going back in our projection to 2 percent.",1442487503.0,6.0,1442487563.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
"It’s awfully close in 2017, and it’s not terribly far away even next year.",1442487517.0,7.0,1442487577.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" We have very large  drags from import prices and energy prices, and over the next year or so, those things should dissipate.",1442487535.0,7.0,1442487595.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
 But the overshooting helps it get back faster than it otherwise would.,1442487588.0,6.0,1442487648.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
So let me be clear—2 percent is our objective.,1442487649.0,6.0,1442487709.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
 So we’re not trying to push the inflation rate above 2.,1442487664.0,6.0,1442487724.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
" It’s always our objective to get back to 2, but 2 percent is not a ceiling.",1442487673.0,6.0,1442487733.0,5.0,-1.0,2.0
" And if it were a ceiling, you would have to be conducting a policy that, on average,would hold the inflation rate below 2 percent.",1442487679.0,6.0,1442487739.0,5.0,-1.0,2.0
 The question is whether or not there might be a risk of a more abrupt slowdown than most analysts expect.,1442487950.0,4.0,1442488010.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
"In addition, we saw a very substantial downward pressure on oil prices and commodity markets, and those developments have had a significant impact on many emerging market economies that are important producers of commodities as well as more advanced countries, including Canada, which is an important trading partner of ours that has been negatively affected by declining commodity prices, declining energy prices.",1442488032.0,3.0,1442488092.0,3.0,0.0,0.0
"Now, there are a lot of countries that are net importers of energy that are positively affected by those developments, but emerging markets—important emerging markets—have been negatively affected by those developments.",1442488035.0,3.0,1442488095.0,3.0,0.0,0.0
" So a lot of our focus has been on risks around China, but not just China— emerging markets, more generally, and how they may spill over to the United States.",1442488053.0,3.0,1442488113.0,3.0,0.0,0.0
" But when there are significant financial developments, it’s incumbent on us to ask ourselves what is causing them.",1442488080.0,3.0,1442488140.0,3.0,0.0,0.0
" And, of course, while we can’t know for sure, it seemed to us as though concerns about the global economic outlook were drivers of those financial developments.",1442488098.0,3.0,1442488158.0,3.0,0.0,0.0
 We have some concerns about negative impacts from global developments and some tightening of financial conditions.,1442488161.0,4.0,1442488221.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
 We’re trying to put all of that together in a picture.,1442488169.0,4.0,1442488229.0,5.0,1.0,3.0
 Can I completely rule it out?,1442488230.0,5.0,1442488290.0,3.0,-2.0,1.0
 I can’t completely rule it out.,1442488233.0,5.0,1442488293.0,3.0,-2.0,1.0
" So, if we maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy for a very long time from here and the economy performs as we expect—namely, it’s strong and the risks that are out there don’t materialize—my concern will be that we will have much more tightening in labor markets than you see in these projections.",1442488341.0,4.0,1442488401.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
" And the lags will be probably slow, but eventually we will find ourselves with a substantial overshoot of our inflation objective, and then we’ll be forced into a kind of stop–go policy.",1442488346.0,4.0,1442488406.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
" We will have pushed the economy so far it will have become overheated, and we will then have to tighten policy more abruptly than we’d like.",1442488351.0,4.0,1442488411.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
 That’s something we’ve seen in several European countries.,1442488441.0,6.0,1442488501.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
 It’s not something we talked about today.,1442488457.0,6.0,1442488517.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"So you ask me about my own expectation, and I’d say—I don’t want to—I speak on behalf of the Committee and try to explain Committee decisions, and we don’t identify who’s who in terms of our projections of the funds rate, and I don’t want to change that and have the focus be on my personal views on the path.",1442488549.0,6.0,1442488609.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
"So I think the main drivers of the turbulence have been concerns about the global outlook, that’s how I read it.",1442488584.0,7.0,1442488644.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" But I know that, of course, there is uncertainty about Fed policy.",1442488586.0,7.0,1442488646.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" As I mentioned, we’re well aware that there’s been a huge focus on the decision today.",1442488591.0,7.0,1442488651.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
 We do our darndest to pull together the best analysis we can and to exchange views and to arrive at Committee decisions.,1442488635.0,7.0,1442488695.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" I do understand that, during this intermeeting period, that every word that an FOMC member has said has been parsed for its potential implications for what our decision will be.",1442488653.0,7.0,1442488713.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" When we—when monetary policy tightens and interest rates rise, it commonly is the case, either when it happens or in expectation—the expectation that that’s coming—interest rate differentials globally do tend to reduce capital flows that have impacts on exchange rates.",1442488747.0,7.0,1442488807.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" So, are we counting on it?",1442488822.0,7.0,1442488882.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
" And, remember, we’re envisioning, if things go as we anticipate, a pretty gradual path of increases in short-term interest rates over time.",1442488873.0,6.0,1442488933.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
" On the other hand, as time passes and we move beyond the window in which short rates are zero, it will be natural for long rates to rise some.",1442488891.0,7.0,1442488951.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" And, of course, we recognize that the housing market is sensitive to mortgage rates.",1442488892.0,7.0,1442488952.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
 It’s a—it is an important factor.,1442488893.0,7.0,1442488953.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"Well, I guess I really don’t see it that way.",1442488933.0,7.0,1442488993.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" It is true that interest rates affect asset prices, but they have a complex effect through balance sheets, through liabilities and assets.",1442488951.0,7.0,1442489011.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" To me, the main thing that an accommodative monetary policy does is put people back to work.",1442488955.0,7.0,1442489015.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
We have been—and this was reported in the minutes of our July meeting—we have been discussing reinvestment policy.,1442489180.0,3.0,1442489240.0,3.0,0.0,0.0
