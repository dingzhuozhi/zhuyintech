  So I think it has to do with the balance of risks and confidence in the economic outlook and not simply the level of the federal funds rate,1489574529.0,2.0,1489574589.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
"I’ve met a couple of times with the Treasury Secretary, and I’m getting to know him",1489574958.0,6.0,1489575018.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
 Three percent is the longer-run normal federal funds rate that participants estimate,1489575060.0,6.0,1489575120.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
" In real terms, with a 2 percent inflation objective—that’s 1 percent in real terms",1489575064.0,7.0,1489575124.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" We had indicated in December that we expect—we saw the risks as balanced, and if the economy continued to progress along the lines we expected, that several rate increases would likely be appropriate",1489575247.0,7.0,1489575307.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
 The minutes of our January meeting indicated that many participants thought that an increase in the funds rate would be appropriate fairly soon if things continued along those lines,1489575260.0,7.0,1489575320.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" And, as I think all of us—having that expectation and that if the economy continued to progress along the lines that we expected and we continued to see the risks as balanced—do regard it as appropriate to gradually remove accommodation that’s in place by having several interest rate increases this year",1489575321.0,7.0,1489575381.0,5.0,-2.0,1.0
" So I think there are reasons, but it is important for the public to understand that we’re getting closer to reaching our objectives; that policy is accommodative; that although the level of the neutral federal funds rate is probably quite low, we nevertheless have an accommodative stance of policy; and it will be appropriate to gradually move toward a neutral stance if we continue on the path we’re on",1489575430.0,5.0,1489575490.0,4.0,-1.0,2.0
" We also noticed that, in the last several months, that risk spreads, particularly for lower-grade corporate issuers, have narrowed, which is another signal that financial conditions have become somewhat easier",1489575486.0,4.0,1489575546.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
" Now, on the other side, longer-term interest rates are up some in recent months, and the dollar is a little stronger",1489575491.0,4.0,1489575551.0,4.0,0.0,0.0
" It’s growing a bit more strongly than it was, perhaps, the last time I got together that the—with my counterparts in the G-20—that the risks do look somewhat more balanced",1489575601.0,4.0,1489575661.0,6.0,2.0,4.0
" But there remain a set of very significant risks, medium term, facing the global economy, and I’m sure that those will be discussed as well",1489575605.0,5.0,1489575665.0,6.0,1.0,3.0
 And I wouldn’t say at this point that I have seen hard evidence of any change in spending decisions based on expectations about the future,1489575666.0,6.0,1489575726.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
" I—there is noise always in the data from quarter to quarter, but we haven’t changed our view of the outlook",1489576029.0,4.0,1489576089.0,5.0,1.0,3.0
 So we’re—we’re talking about a gradual path of removing policy accommodation as the economy makes progress moving toward neutral,1489576080.0,5.0,1489576140.0,3.0,-2.0,1.0
 I’m not aware of anything concrete to react to,1489576208.0,2.0,1489576268.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" The unemployment rate has moved way down, and many more people feel optimistic about their prospects in the labor market",1489576262.0,2.0,1489576322.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
 There is job security,1489576270.0,2.0,1489576330.0,1.0,-1.0,2.0
" We’re seeing more people who are feeling free to quit their jobs, getting outside offers, looking for other opportunities",1489576279.0,1.0,1489576339.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" And inflation is moving— moving up, I think, toward our 2 percent objective",1489576323.0,1.0,1489576383.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
 And we’re operating in an environment where the U-S- economy is performing well and risks seem pretty balanced,1489576327.0,1.0,1489576387.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
 So I think people can feel good about the economic outlook,1489576330.0,1.0,1489576390.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"  Now, headline inflation has moved almost back up to 2 percent",1489576386.0,1.0,1489576446.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
" And there will be some times when inflation is above 2 percent, just like it’s been below 2 percent",1489576445.0,2.0,1489576505.0,2.0,0.0,0.0
" I mean, if—if the latter were to occur, there were just a big boost in the dollar, it would tend to put downward pressure on inflation and would have a negative effect on U-S- export growth and tend to boost imports",1489576622.0,1.0,1489576682.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
