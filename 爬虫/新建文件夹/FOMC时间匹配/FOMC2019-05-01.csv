"So, yes, we did discuss tax policy, and let me say that most of my colleagues factored in the prospect of fiscal stimulus along the lines of what’s being contemplated by Congress into their projections.",1513161682.0,1.0,1513161742.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" Now, I should emphasize that some have been incorporating those expectations into their projections throughout the year, so changes to the projections that you see since September should not be viewed as an impact—an estimate of the impact of the tax package.",1513161706.0,1.0,1513161766.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" And, in particular, broader expectations of changes to fiscal policy have been reflected in financial market conditions, I think, over the past year.",1513161708.0,1.0,1513161768.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" I think my colleagues and I are in line with the general expectation among most economists that the type of tax changes that are likely to be enacted would tend to provide some modest lift to GDP growth in the coming years, and you see that—in part, that’s one of the reasons, I think, for the uptick you see in estimated growth and decline in the unemployment rate.",1513161794.0,1.0,1513161854.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"The views of participants, I believe, have been informed by a wide range of analysis, including that of the Joint Committee on Taxation and other outside evaluators, and my sense is that their estimates are essentially in the same ballpark, although they recognize, as I emphasized, that there is considerable uncertainty about the impacts, and that will have to be monitored over time.",1513161814.0,1.0,1513161874.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" More specifically, they tend to see the package as boosting both consumer spending and capital spending, to some extent.",1513161824.0,1.0,1513161884.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" I guess I would also urge you to remember that when you look at the projections, that there are many factors that affect those projections, and changes in tax policy— that’s only one of a number of factors, including incoming data that has, to some extent, altered the outlook for growth and inflation.",1513161861.0,1.0,1513161921.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
 All of that factors into the projections you see.,1513161874.0,1.0,1513161934.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"But I think, bottom line, when you look at assessments of the funds rate path, participants continue to see gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate as being appropriate to sustain a strong labor market and bring inflation back to 2 percent.",1513161897.0,1.0,1513161957.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" And, look— importantly, there is a lot of uncertainty about what the likely effects will be, and my colleagues and I will be committed, as always, to evaluating incoming data and altering the outlook as appropriate.",1513161912.0,1.0,1513161972.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" That leaves me—that’s one factor, along with the fact that inflation remains low—with feeling that even though we have a 4.1 percent unemployment rate, that the labor market is not overheated at this point.",1513161959.0,1.0,1513162019.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" Remember, the modest pace of wage gains also probably reflects slow productivity growth.",1513161959.0,1.0,1513162019.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" This is a symmetric 2 percent inflation objective, and we continue to indicate that we’ll be monitoring inflation developments closely.",1513162007.0,1.0,1513162067.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
 And so this is on the horizon and recognized to be one of the risks facing policy.,1513162012.0,1.0,1513162072.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"So I think my colleagues and I mainly see the likely tax package as boosting aggregate demand, but also having some potential to boost aggregate supply.",1513162090.0,1.0,1513162150.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
" So changes on the corporate tax side—the reduction in the corporate tax rate, expensing—will lower the cost of capital.",1513162110.0,0.0,1513162170.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
" And while there are a range of estimates and uncertainty about how much stimulus that will provide to investment, in general I would see some stimulus to investment.",1513162127.0,0.0,1513162187.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"In terms of aggregate supply effects, a stronger pace of investment could boost capital formation and thereby raise productivity growth and potential GDP or output to some extent.",1513162129.0,0.0,1513162189.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
" Exactly how large those effects might be remain uncertain, but that is a channel.",1513162135.0,0.0,1513162195.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
 And I suppose it’s also possible—I’m uncertain how significant this would be—that lower marginal effective tax rates for those groups that will see them could boost labor supply.,1513162151.0,0.0,1513162211.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
" And, again, there are a range of estimates in the literatures.",1513162155.0,0.0,1513162215.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
So there are potentially both demand and supply effects here.,1513162225.0,0.0,1513162285.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
"Well, I think, generally, in a strong labor market where many firms are having difficulty finding qualified workers, we would expect, just through normal demand and supply channels, to see some upward pressure on wage growth over time.",1513162317.0,1.0,1513162377.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" And as the labor market is tightened, we’ve seen some very gradual drift upward in wage gains.",1513162319.0,1.0,1513162379.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" They remain—it remains at a low level, but I would expect, in the context of an ongoing strong labor market, to see some upward pressure.",1513162323.0,1.0,1513162383.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
factoring in.,1513162332.0,1.0,1513162392.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"On your question on advice to women and minorities, in the Federal Reserve, my colleagues and I are very focused on wanting to see and do what we can to foster greater participation of women and minorities in economics.",1513162368.0,1.0,1513162428.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" And, just in terms of the kinds of research that’s done in the field, I think also a greater diversity, more women and minorities, may change the focus to some extent of the questions that people choose to look at and the analysis that they bring and a range of thinking that bears on research.",1513162448.0,1.0,1513162508.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"  So let me start, Steve, with the stock market generally.",1513162497.0,1.0,1513162557.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"  I mean, of course the stock market has gone up a great deal this year, and we have in recent months characterized the general level of asset valuations as “elevated.",1513162521.0,1.0,1513162581.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"” What that reflects is simply the assessment that, looking at price/earnings ratios and comparable metrics for other assets other than equities, we see ratios that are at the high end of historical ranges—and so that’s worth pointing out.",1513162541.0,1.0,1513162601.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
 But economists are not great at knowing what appropriate valuations are.,1513162551.0,1.0,1513162611.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"We don’t have a terrific record, and the fact that those valuations are high doesn’t mean that they are necessarily overvalued.",1513162552.0,1.0,1513162612.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"We are in a—I’ve mentioned this in my opening statement, and we’ve talked about this repeatedly—likely a low interest rate environment, lower than we’ve had in past decades.",1513162571.0,1.0,1513162631.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" And if that turns out to be the case, that’s a factor that supports higher valuations.",1513162573.0,1.0,1513162633.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" We’re enjoying solid economic growth with low inflation, and the risks in the global economy look more balanced than they have in many years.",1513162589.0,1.0,1513162649.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" So I think what we need to and are trying to think through is, if there were an adjustment in asset valuations or the stock market, what impact would that have on the economy, and would it provoke financial stability concerns?",1513162608.0,1.0,1513162668.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" And I think when we look at other indicators of financial stability risks, there’s nothing flashing red there or possibly even orange.",1513162614.0,1.0,1513162674.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"1 So, you know, this is something that the FOMC pays attention to, but if you ask me, is this a significant factor shaping monetary policy now, well, it’s on the list of risks, it’s not a major—it’s not a major factor.",1513162659.0,1.0,1513162719.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"And then you asked about bitcoin, and there I would simply say that bitcoin at this time plays a very small role in the payment system.",1513162660.0,1.0,1513162720.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
" It is not a stable source of—store of value, and it doesn’t constitute legal tender.",1513162660.0,1.0,1513162720.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"So, look, I will just say that it is up to the Administration and Congress to decide on appropriate fiscal policy, and our job is to maintain our focus on employment and inflation.",1513162776.0,0.0,1513162836.0,4.0,4.0,4.0
" We continue to think, as you can see from the projections, that a gradual path of rate increases remains appropriate even with almost all participants now factoring in their assessment of the impact of the tax—the tax policy.",1513162809.0,3.0,1513162869.0,3.0,0.0,0.0
"You know, it is projected that the tax cut package will lead to additions to the national debt and boost, by the end of the horizon, the debt-to-GDP ratio.",1513162814.0,3.0,1513162874.0,3.0,0.0,0.0
" We do see inflation as likely moving up to target over the next couple of years, and I would say—you said our stimulus tools are limited.",1513162948.0,0.0,1513163008.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
" I would want to emphasize that if there were a negative shock to the economy, we do have some scope to cut the fed funds rate, and there are other tools available, ones that we have used previously: forward guidance and asset purchases.",1513162973.0,1.0,1513163033.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
" And, in that context, I think additional research—the academic economists and others are thinking hard about what more could be done, and I think these are matters that are certainly worthy of further study.",1513163013.0,0.0,1513163073.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
"So, I mean, on that I would say we have—that’s not something that we have studied inside the Fed to any considerable extent and haven’t seriously thought about using ourselves during this last downturn and recovery.",1513163030.0,0.0,1513163090.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
 We have watched what’s happened in other countries.,1513163030.0,0.0,1513163090.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
 I think that’s worthwhile.,1513163041.0,0.0,1513163101.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
" And I would say it’s an area that academics may have interest in in the future and is worthy of some study, but it hasn’t been part of the Fed’s agenda.",1513163054.0,1.0,1513163114.0,0.0,-1.0,2.0
"Well, I mean, you know, I think I’m not familiar with every detail of the bill, but I think the bill does address a wide range of issues that, you know, we’ve highlighted in the past as being ones where perhaps additional flexibility to tailor our supervisory requirements would be worthwhile.",1513163117.0,0.0,1513163177.0,1.0,1.0,3.0
 So I don’t have additional things on the congressional list.,1513163125.0,1.0,1513163185.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
"So, you know, we continue to work seriously on resolution and the resolution plans, the living wills, and the structure of systemic firms to ensure that it would be possible to resolve a firm—under the bankruptcy code would be the top choice of methods, or, alternatively, under the Orderly Liquidation Authority.",1513163167.0,1.0,1513163227.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
"  And I think it’s fair to say that, over time, we have learned more ourselves and more clearly detailed our expectations for the firms that file living wills.",1513163172.0,1.0,1513163232.0,2.0,1.0,3.0
" And the firms themselves have made considerable progress in, you know, changing what they do, whether it’s adopting financial contracts that would facilitate a resolution rather than a disorderly unwinding of contracts, making sure that they’re appropriately dealing with shared services so that key services would be able to continue, governance arrangements, legal entity structures—the firms have all made progress in adapting to our expectations of what would enable a successful resolution.",1513163216.0,2.0,1513163276.0,5.0,3.0,4.0
" So I think it’s an ongoing process, and I believe we have made substantial progress.",1513163251.0,2.0,1513163311.0,4.0,2.0,4.0
"Well, you know, the projections that we’re showing you today, many factors went into that, fiscal policy being one of a number of different factors.",1513163275.0,5.0,1513163335.0,4.0,-1.0,2.0
" And, you know,you’re looking at 16 participants who have made adjustments to their economic outlook for a whole variety of reasons, including, in some cases, rethinking some of the fundamentals that went into their original forecast.",1513163293.0,4.0,1513163353.0,5.0,1.0,3.0
 So there have been modifications in different directions by different participants.,1513163303.0,4.0,1513163363.0,5.0,1.0,3.0
 So I would caution you about the dangers of looking at the median and acting like that is one individual who has made a change to their forecast.,1513163310.0,4.0,1513163370.0,5.0,1.0,3.0
 That’s a leap that isn’t quite justified.,1513163313.0,4.0,1513163373.0,5.0,1.0,3.0
"But, look, generally, you see modestly faster growth over the next couple of years, which is consistent and, I said, I think for most participants, reflects partly an impact from taxes stimulating consumer and investment spending.",1513163343.0,5.0,1513163403.0,4.0,-1.0,2.0
 But it’s not a gigantic increase in growth that since—relative to September.,1513163352.0,5.0,1513163412.0,6.0,1.0,3.0
"You do see a lower path for unemployment, but remember that inflation has also been running low on a persistent basis, and the Committee does have a concern about inflation and wants to see it moving up.",1513163369.0,5.0,1513163429.0,6.0,1.0,3.0
" And, on balance, you see only modest changes, slight revisions to the path for the fed funds rate.",1513163372.0,5.0,1513163432.0,6.0,1.0,3.0
" You might think, well, shouldn’t I see more?",1513163374.0,5.0,1513163434.0,6.0,1.0,3.0
" Well, okay, growth is a little stronger, the unemployment rate runs a little bit lower—that would perhaps push in the direction of slightly tighter monetary policy.",1513163388.0,4.0,1513163448.0,6.0,2.0,4.0
" But, again, counterbalancing that is that inflation has run lower than we expect, and, you know, it could take a longer period of a very strong labor market in order to achieve the inflation objective.",1513163411.0,6.0,1513163471.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
So I want to distinguish carefully between digital currency and cryptocurrency.,1513163430.0,6.0,1513163490.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
 And so I would really doubt that the Federal Reserve would soon go in that direction.,1513163490.0,6.0,1513163550.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
 But it is something that central banks are looking at to see if there could be benefits from doing it.,1513163495.0,6.0,1513163555.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
So I would agree with you that these are important appointments.,1513163559.0,6.0,1513163619.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
"Under the Federal Reserve Act, the nonbanking directors of the Reserve Banks have responsibility for conducting a search, and the Board of Governors has to sign off on the candidates.",1513163581.0,7.0,1513163641.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"  We’ve made very clear and we monitor ongoing searches very carefully to make sure that absolutely every effort is made to create a pool that is diverse, and that there be a national search, and that every attempt should be made to create a diverse pool.",1513163614.0,7.0,1513163674.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" At the end of the day, we cannot guarantee that the outcomes of these searches will result in an increase in diversity.",1513163624.0,7.0,1513163684.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" I mean, I’ve been very pleased to see that there’s been some success in that regard, but we have signed off on the individuals who were appointed and have held the view that these are individuals who were qualified to serve in these positions.",1513163640.0,7.0,1513163700.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
  So I would hope—I would hope to see greater diversity.,1513163641.0,7.0,1513163701.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
 It has been a challenge to achieve that.,1513163646.0,7.0,1513163706.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"Well, I think the process has become more open, and in a number of the recent searches there has been outreach—public outreach, information on websites, acceptance of potential names and nominees, and those have gotten careful consideration.",1513163680.0,7.0,1513163740.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" There has been—there have been meetings in some cases with community groups to try to enlarge the pool and get suggestions, and I think that’s appropriate, and I think it has moved in the direction you’re suggesting.",1513163693.0,7.0,1513163753.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"Well, my colleague—I’ve had the pleasure of working with him now for many years, and he is somebody who understands the Federal Reserve very well and shares its values.",1513163713.0,7.0,1513163773.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" And as I mentioned in my opening statement, he is committed to the mission of the Fed; to its independence; and to its acting in a nonpartisan, nonpolitical way.",1513163728.0,7.0,1513163788.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
 He is somebody who has participated in the FOMC now for many years.,1513163729.0,7.0,1513163789.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" To the best of my knowledge, he has been part of the consensus.",1513163733.0,7.0,1513163793.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
 I don’t believe he’s ever dissented.,1513163733.0,7.0,1513163793.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" In supervision, in the payment system—he’s played an active role there—and in monetary policy, and I have confidence that he is very capable of steering the Federal Reserve in the years ahead.",1513163782.0,7.0,1513163842.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
So I would say that all of my colleagues on the Board have expressed a strong commitment to keep in place the core reforms that have produced a stronger financial system.,1513163857.0,7.0,1513163917.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" And I’m considering there stronger capital, particularly for the most systemic institutions—higher-quality capital, stronger liquidity requirements, a rigorous stress-testing program, and resolution planning that will make it more possible to resolve a firm that encounters significant distress.",1513163888.0,7.0,1513163948.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
"So I have heard broad-based commitment to those things, and I think they are the core of the reforms we have put in place.",1513163900.0,7.0,1513163960.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
 I think all of us agree that it is appropriate to tailor regulatory requirements in all of those areas and others to the systemic footprint of firms.,1513163907.0,7.0,1513163967.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" We have done a lot to do that, and I think there is more that could be done, and in some areas it would require legislation in order to do that.",1513163915.0,7.0,1513163975.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" But I believe all of my colleagues and I are in agreement on that, and we’re also focused on community banks and want to find ways to relieve burdens.",1513163928.0,7.0,1513163988.0,7.0,0.0,0.0
" So in those important ways, I do think that all of my colleagues are in the same place with respect to their priorities.",1513163938.0,7.0,1513163998.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
 So I have not seen anything emerge at this point that I would describe as a significant difference.,1513163947.0,7.0,1513164007.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
 So you asked about the risk list.,1513163989.0,7.0,1513164049.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
 There are always risks that affect the outlook.,1513163996.0,6.0,1513164056.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
" We tend to focus in our own evaluation on economic risks, and we’ve characterized them as “balanced.",1513164005.0,6.0,1513164065.0,6.0,0.0,0.0

"Let’s see, I think you also then asked me about the yield curve, and—I mean, there is much discussion about yield curve inversions and whether or not a flattening yield curve could signal a recession.",1513164833.0,7.0,1513164893.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
 Is that the brunt of your question?,1513164842.0,7.0,1513164902.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
So this is something that we discussed and have looked at.,1513164845.0,7.0,1513164905.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
 The yield curve has flattened some as we have raised short rates.,1513164854.0,7.0,1513164914.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
 It mainly—the flattening yield curve mainly reflects higher short-term rates.,1513164855.0,7.0,1513164915.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
" The yield curve is not currently inverted, and I would say that the current slope is well within its historical range.",1513164870.0,7.0,1513164930.0,6.0,-1.0,2.0
"Now, there is a strong correlation historically between yield curve inversions and recessions, but let me emphasize that correlation is not causation, and I think that there are good reasons to think that the relationship between the slope of the yield curve and the business cycle may have changed.",1513164900.0,6.0,1513164960.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
 And one reason for that is that long-term interest rates generally embody two factors.,1513164906.0,6.0,1513164966.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
" One is the expected average value of short rates over, say, 10 years, and the second piece of it is a so-called term premium that often reflects things like inflation—inflation risk.",1513164920.0,6.0,1513164980.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
"Typically, the term premium historically has been positive.",1513164925.0,6.0,1513164985.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
" So when the yield curve has inverted historically, it meant that short-term rates were well above average expected short rates over the longer run.",1513164935.0,6.0,1513164995.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
" So with the positive term premium, that’s what it means.",1513164940.0,6.0,1513165000.0,6.0,0.0,0.0
" And typically that means that monetary policy is restrictive, sometimes quite restrictive, and some of those recessions were situations in which the Fed was consciously tightening monetary policy because inflation was high and trying to slow the economy.",1513164972.0,6.0,1513165032.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
"Well, right now the term premium is estimated to be quite low, close to zero, and that means that, structurally—and this can be true going forward—that the yield curve is likely to be flatter than it’s been in the past.",1513164975.0,6.0,1513165035.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
  And so it could more easily invert.,1513164984.0,6.0,1513165044.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
"  If the Fed were to even move to a slightly restrictive policy stance, you could see an inversion with a zero term premium.",1513164989.0,6.0,1513165049.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
So I think the fact the term premium is so low and the yield curve is generally flatter is an important factor to consider.,1513165004.0,6.0,1513165064.0,7.0,1.0,3.0
