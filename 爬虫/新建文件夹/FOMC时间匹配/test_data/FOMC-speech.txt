2019-10-31 02:29:19.058749	let' s listen to jay powell in washington.
2019-10-31 02:29:26.810112	mr. powell: my colleagues at the federal reserve and i are dedicated to serving the american people.
2019-10-31 02:29:33.040859	we do this by steadfastly pursuing the goals that has given us -- maximum employment and stable prices.
2019-10-31 02:29:39.062056	we are committed to making the best decisions we can they' s on facts and objective analysis.
2019-10-31 02:29:43.541461	today we decided to lower interest rates for the third time this year.
2019-10-31 02:29:52.041577	we took this step to help keep the u.s. economy strong in the face of global developments to provide insurance against ongoing risks.
2019-10-31 02:30:01.040661	as i will explain shortly, the policy adjustments are and will continue to provide meaningful support to the economy.
2019-10-31 02:30:05.295573	we believe monetary policy is in a good place.
2019-10-31 02:30:38.733690	sectors.
2019-10-31 02:30:46.827404	looking ahead we expect the economy to expand and a rate, reflecting solid household spending and supportive financial conditions.
2019-10-31 02:30:50.013372	the job market remains strong.
2019-10-31 02:30:55.810543	the unemployment rate has been year half-century flows for a year and a half.
2019-10-31 02:31:01.062904	we had expected some slowing after last year' s strong pace.
2019-10-31 02:31:08.813735	participation in the dbor force by people in their prime working years has been increasing.
2019-10-31 02:31:11.976527	jobs.
2019-10-31 02:31:22.296714	people in low and middle- communities tell us that many who have struggled to find are getting opportunities to a new and better chapters for the lives.
2019-10-31 02:31:31.332226	this underscores for us the importance of sustaining expansion to the strong job market reaches those left behind.
2019-10-31 02:31:36.049748	inflation continues to run our symmetric 10% objective.
2019-10-31 02:31:44.582775	over the 1 2 months through august, total pce inflation was 1.4%, and core inflation was 1.8%.
2019-10-31 02:31:54.049838	inflation pressures remained muted, and indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are at the lower end of the historic ranges.
2019-10-31 02:32:03.084232	we are mindful that below  we are lindful that below inflation could lead to a downward slide in long-term inflation executions.
2019-10-31 02:32:22.545959	however, against the backdrop the strong economy and supportive monetary policy, we expect inflation will rise to 2% i overall, we continue to see sustained expansion of activity, strong labor market, and the 2% objective as most likely.
2019-10-31 02:32:33.566582	while this has been our outlook for quite some time, the views about the path of interest rates that will best achieve these outcomes have changed significantly over the past year.
2019-10-31 02:33:00.564672	as we mentioned, weakness in global growth and trade opponents have weight on the economy and post ongoing these factors in conjunction with inflation pressures have led us to lower our assessment of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate over the past in both july or september, we reduced the target rate by one quarter percentage point and did so again today, bringing the range to one and three percent.
2019-10-31 02:33:09.547742	the policy adjustments we made will provide significant support for the economy.
2019-10-31 02:33:19.284563	since monetary policy operates with lag, the full effect of these intestines on economic growth and the job market and inflation be realized over time.
2019-10-31 02:33:39.033589	we see the current stance of monetary policy is likely to remain appropriate, as long as incoming information about economy means broadly with our outlook of moderate economic growth, a strong market, and inflation near our symmetric 2% objective.
2019-10-31 02:33:43.068993	a good place to achieve these outcomes.
2019-10-31 02:33:55.550608	monitoring the effects of policy actions along with other information bearing on the outlook come as we assess the appropriate path of the target range for the fed funds rate.
2019-10-31 02:34:02.036554	of course, if development the cause a material reassessment of the outlook, will respond accordingly.
2019-10-31 02:34:05.204448	course.
2019-10-31 02:34:09.783799	let me end with a few words about the monetary policy operations.
2019-10-31 02:34:17.303672	in january we made the decision to implement monetary policy apple reserves regime.
2019-10-31 02:34:27.051065	in the operating framework, we control the federal funds rate primarily by setting out administered rates come not through frequent to manage the supply of reserves.
2019-10-31 02:34:37.290868	in the transition to the efficient and effective level of reserves in this regime, we slowed the gradual decline in a balance sheet in march and we stopped it in july.
2019-10-31 02:35:52.053407	supply of reserves only alters the mix of short-term assets held by the public and should not materially affect demand supply for longer-term securities or conditions more broadly.
2019-10-31 02:35:55.788254	questions.
2019-10-31 02:37:01.057822	low unemployment, attractive levels of job creation, solid gains and many measures of consumer spending.
2019-10-31 02:37:11.058309	the manufacturing sector has been weaker but we have seen inflation moving up.
2019-10-31 02:37:14.229273	the same.
2019-10-31 02:37:23.310516	we saw the risks to the outlook as moving in a positive direction over the course of this period.
2019-10-31 02:37:32.310335	turning to policy, we have the sense of policy to a more accommodative stance.
2019-10-31 02:37:38.558704	readings, the federal funds rate is between 1 .5 and 1 .75 percent.
2019-10-31 02:37:42.045018	well-positioned to support the outlook i described.
2019-10-31 02:38:34.546445	if something happens to cost us to materially reassess the outlook, that will cause us to change our views.
2019-10-31 02:38:41.560838	reporter: heather long from washington post."
2019-10-31 02:38:47.546357	you said the risks to the outlook are moving to a direction.
2019-10-31 02:40:33.800605	consumer is really driving growth, and personal expenditures were almost 3% in this quarter come in this first reading for the quarter.
2019-10-31 02:40:41.834065	overall we see the economy as having been resilient to the winds blowing this year.
2019-10-31 02:40:56.800639	reporter: just to follow up quickly, it was concerned i sometimes hear that with businesses that cut investment, will they turn around and cut employment if they continue to be concerned.
2019-10-31 02:41:05.550675	through the policy? mr. powell: so that is a risk, a risk we have been monitoring, but we are not seeing it.
2019-10-31 02:41:09.302668	claims or anwhing like that.
2019-10-31 02:41:17.801231	but the risk of weakness in the manufacturing and business investment parts the economy getting into the consumer side, we really don' t see that.
2019-10-31 02:41:29.035744	what we continue to see is good job creation and unemployment has declined again in the hassle survey is that a 50-year low and had been very close to 50-year lows for months now.
2019-10-31 02:41:45.301115	it is very positive that the consumer-facing companies are consumers are doing well, focused on the good job rising incomes, and the principle focus.
2019-10-31 02:41:52.284178	that is pushing the economy forward, and it does not seem have been affected by weakness in the other areas.
2019-10-31 02:42:08.284598	reporter: ''new york times.'' you previously compared this rate cutting cycle to the insurance cuts in the 1990' s.
2019-10-31 02:42:14.820449	in both of those instances, they took those cuts back after a while.
2019-10-31 02:42:17.971425	they raise rates quickly.
2019-10-31 02:42:21.804459	i' m wondering what the onus for doing that this cycle.
2019-10-31 02:43:08.538956	inflation expectations have moved down and sideways, both surveys and market-based over the course of recent months.
2019-10-31 02:43:14.537798	we think that inflation expectations are very important in driving actual inflation.
2019-10-31 02:43:20.787597	we are strongly committed to achieving out 2% inflation objective on a symmetric basis.
2019-10-31 02:43:24.540536	we are not thinking about raising rates right now.
2019-10-31 02:43:29.040647	there will be times in the future when that will be appropriate.
2019-10-31 02:43:42.291852	what we' re thinking now is our current stance of policy is appropriate and will remain so as long as the outlook is probably keeping -- broadly keeping with our expectations.
2019-10-31 02:43:44.807443	reporter: cnbc.
2019-10-31 02:43:56.074544	mr. chairman, not to make light of it, but i' m wondering if you can help me out with the appropriate understanding of word '' appropriate'' here.
2019-10-31 02:44:04.041363	the statement says that the community will monitor the implication and assesses the appropriate path of the target range.
2019-10-31 02:44:06.290756	that tells me you could go in the way.
2019-10-31 02:44:44.810455	economy is probably consistent with our outlook, which is the positive one of moderate economic growth, strong labor economic crowth, strc>nc labor  ecc.-1c,--1 c g-c,--th. s'-cjlg la3-.3- market, and inflation moving close to 2%.
2019-10-31 02:44:53.310669	we also say that if emerge that cause material reassessment, we would accordingly.
2019-10-31 02:44:56.043177	that is how we are thinking about it.
2019-10-31 02:45:06.043666	it would be a reassessment, material reassessment of the outlook, which is what i described.
2019-10-31 02:45:11.562331	reporter: why is in the phrase "
2019-10-31 02:45:24.546008	that' s why isn' t the phrase ''like- to be appropriate'' in the statement if that is the of the committee? mr. powell: that is practice and science and history of how you put in a post many same as opposed to a press conference statement.
2019-10-31 02:45:26.060706	it is a judgment call.
2019-10-31 02:45:29.230991	i' m saying it now.
2019-10-31 02:45:34.044597	reporter: thank you.
2019-10-31 02:45:35.811992	''wall street journal."
2019-10-31 02:45:40.329552	you described the recent slide in inflation expectations as unwelcome.
2019-10-31 02:45:44.059844	you said inflation expectations are important.
2019-10-31 02:46:08.545671	what if anything, with a committee be prepared to a true to address this slide --be prepared to do to address this slide in extraditions? -- expectations? mr. powell: they are quite central in our framework and need them to be anchored at a level that is consistent with our 2% inflation goal.
2019-10-31 02:46:15.062874	we think that we need to policy in a way that supports the outcome.
2019-10-31 02:46:18.545675	that is what we are doing now.
2019-10-31 02:46:35.810745	we also as part of our review looking at the potential innovation and changes to the way we think about things and changes to the framework that would lead us -- be more supportive of achieving inflation on the 2% -- symmetric 2% basis over time.
2019-10-31 02:46:39.297127	that is at the heart of what we are doing.
2019-10-31 02:46:41.300203	it is too early to be announcing decisions.
2019-10-31 02:46:51.310501	we are in the middle of thinking about ways you can make the inflation objective more credible by achieving the 2% inflation.
2019-10-31 02:46:56.828146	it comes down to using policy tools to achieve 2% inflation.
2019-10-31 02:47:05.564386	that is the thing that must happen for credibility in this area.
2019-10-31 02:47:11.298256	we are committed to doing reporter: you think that might be announced to the public? mr. powell: we are in the middle of it now.
2019-10-31 02:47:14.565007	my thinking is that it will run into the middle of next year.
2019-10-31 02:47:22.548297	these changes to monetary frameworks don' t have been really quickly.
2019-10-31 02:47:24.565983	inflation targeting took many years to evolve.
2019-10-31 02:47:29.065567	i don' t think we will take many years here.
2019-10-31 02:47:33.799206	we will wrap it up around the middle of next year would be my guess.
2019-10-31 02:47:38.049549	reporter: fox business.
2019-10-31 02:47:40.297147	thank you, mr. chairman.
2019-10-31 02:48:08.046322	how big of a change to policy would give me if you get the uncertainty cleared up, specifically the phase one china trade deal finished and usmca ratified? how big of a change without be to monetary policy here? -- would that be monetary here, and rate hikes next year? i' ve heard the argument that uncertainty is keeping the prices low.
2019-10-31 02:48:12.333206	i' ve heard that from fed president from one of the districts.
2019-10-31 02:48:16.567329	if you remove the uncertainty, prices would naturally arise.
2019-10-31 02:48:37.035087	how big of an impact on policy would removing that -- mr. powell: so i would just say that if we were to have a sustained reduction in trade conventions -- trade tensions and a resolution of uncertainties, that would bode well for business sentiment.
2019-10-31 02:48:41.551846	trade uncertainty is weighing business sentiment.
2019-10-31 02:48:47.568369	ultimately it could affect activity.
2019-10-31 02:48:52.568046	i would not affect that the effects would be immediate.
2019-10-31 02:48:58.282029	would there be immediate effect on economic activity? i think it would take some time.
2019-10-31 02:49:02.048643	but i think it would be quite positive over time.
2019-10-31 02:49:04.802961	you come back to the question raising rates.
2019-10-31 02:49:06.302510	that is about inflation.
2019-10-31 02:49:13.549789	we just touched 2% core inflation to pick one measure.
2019-10-31 02:49:17.786182	we just touched it for a few months.
2019-10-31 02:49:29.801632	i think we need to see a significant move up in inflation that is persistent before we consider raising rates.
2019-10-31 02:49:44.335681	reporter: brendan greeley, ''financial times.'' the other thing in this review is the gains that the pressures in the labor market half.
2019-10-31 02:49:46.805314	you mentioned it when you are talking.
2019-10-31 02:50:03.303677	is that something you are identifying and something the fed is learning more about this year, why not continue to push those gains particularly for people reentering the labor force? mr. powell: i think we are doing that.
2019-10-31 02:50:09.056359	i think we have made very substantial adjustments to policy over the course of this year.
2019-10-31 02:50:14.605797	we entered the year expecting some further rate increases, we have done three rate cuts.
2019-10-31 02:50:16.619622	it is a very substantial shift.
2019-10-31 02:50:20.823336	the effects of it will be felt over time.
2019-10-31 02:50:32.071884	we feel like the shifts are appropriate to support exactly the outcomes you are talking about, which are a continuing strong labor market, strong job gratian.
2019-10-31 02:50:39.353977	reporter: describe the shift you made so far, it was not just about trade uncertainty.
2019-10-31 02:50:46.074268	it was these high-pressure labor gains -- mr. powell: well, no, it is about three things.
2019-10-31 02:50:51.575050	the slowing global economy, sinker nice activity building for 18 months now.
2019-10-31 02:50:58.854922	that is having an effect on that is part of the weakness in manufacturing, export, and business investment.
2019-10-31 02:51:05.322161	the trade policy uncertainty, which has been weighing on activity and investment in sentiment.
2019-10-31 02:51:14.308178	and we have had inflation, we have called out the risk of inflation running persistently below 2% as of risk to address.
2019-10-31 02:51:17.841927	we have been doing it to all of those things.
2019-10-31 02:51:25.056833	i would say that the gains in the labor market have been to see.
2019-10-31 02:51:44.576910	and the people at the lower end of the wages the last couple of years, from the fed listens events we have been hearing people who live and work in moderate income communities, this is the best labor market they' ve seen in the lifetime.
2019-10-31 02:52:19.311012	reporter: the fed' s balance sheets -- you resumed purchases of treasury bills.
2019-10-31 02:52:50.829507	i was just wondering, how long do you expect that to continue, and given the fact that the operation -- it seems like the fed is increasing the amount of temporary liquidity it is injecting into the system, do you feel like there is not enough reserves in the system? do you have a good sense of is going on there? mr. powell: on how long can we expect bill purchases to continue into the second order of next year.
2019-10-31 02:52:59.559785	we expect the temporary open market operations -- it can continue until the end of january.
2019-10-31 02:53:08.327465	in terms of the causes, there is a lot of forensic work going on by us and by market participants and all kinds of analysts.
2019-10-31 02:53:28.544384	one thing is we think we need reserves to be that of -- the minimum level of reserves that we can have during the various fluctuations with reserves, something like 1 .40 5 trillion, little higher.
2019-10-31 02:53:32.795226	that is the level in early september.
2019-10-31 02:53:52.061318	maybe one thing that was surprising about the episode is that liquidity did not seem to flow as one might have we have surveyed the banks carefully about what was the lowest comfortable level of reserves.
2019-10-31 02:54:00.299013	many banks that were well that level did not take the excess cash and invest it in the repo market at much higher rates.
2019-10-31 02:54:02.047630	they didn' t do that.
2019-10-31 02:54:20.314607	the question is why, and are the things we can do, adjustments can make that would allow liquidity to flow more easily and the system without in any way sacrificing safety and soundness and financial stability? we are looking at those.
2019-10-31 02:54:27.798222	those cannot really address situation in the short-term, but those are a range of things we' re looking at as well.
2019-10-31 02:54:33.067310	reporter: howard schneider reuters.
2019-10-31 02:54:33.830826	thanks for the questions.
2019-10-31 02:54:46.098008	i wonder if you could give us more texture on what is the strongest or most important cases for the feeling that you have taken the adequate insurance.
2019-10-31 02:55:10.797514	is in the response you are seeing in housing and other parts of the economy to the made so far? is it the fact that the risk environment globally has a bit? or is it something different in the financial markets, the fact that the yield curve -- mr. powell: honestly there anyone factor.
2019-10-31 02:55:18.801868	it is the range of economic data, and what we see about policy come which we believe is the appropriate stance.
2019-10-31 02:55:26.334719	if you look at the performance in the economy through this, consumer sector has been quite resilient.
2019-10-31 02:55:29.297079	witness today' s gdp report.
2019-10-31 02:55:34.798113	and all the things i went through earlier suggest that continues to be strong.
2019-10-31 02:55:39.835035	we know that the investment and trade export sector has been weak.
2019-10-31 02:55:52.301728	overall we have got an that is showing moderate we are now at 1 .5 to 1.75%.
2019-10-31 02:55:58.318937	that is, we believe, an accommodative level and the level that will support the outlook we have.
2019-10-31 02:56:05.302576	reporter: this is kind of a one-legged recovery.
2019-10-31 02:56:14.283037	unless you get support from other things, it is going to weaken further at some point? mr. powell: we don' t see any evidence of that.
2019-10-31 02:56:20.352429	what we see is that the sector continues strong -- again, low initial claims.
2019-10-31 02:56:23.818642	the data we monitor is a very broad range of data.
2019-10-31 02:56:34.570061	we also see now, i think, more clearly the effects of more accommodative monetary various kinds of consumer activity.
2019-10-31 02:56:55.836793	you are seeing strong durable goods sales, you are seeing housing now contributing to growth for the first time in a while -- 2z10, i think, this quarter -- and you are seeing retail sales number, pce number, as i mentioned in today' s release, of 2.9%.
2019-10-31 02:56:59.002433	that is good.
2019-10-31 02:57:11.304485	more probably, monetary policy is supporting household and home buying by keeping the labor market strong and incomes rising and consumer confidence at high levels.
2019-10-31 02:57:18.054252	reporter: thank you, mr.
2019-10-31 02:57:18.588239	chairman.
2019-10-31 02:57:22.805218	you were talking about how the lower rates have affected consumer behavior.
2019-10-31 02:57:35.039329	is there concern that there is less potency on the business investment side, that you are pushing on a string? mr. powell: i think monetary policy works through the channels we understand.
2019-10-31 02:57:43.819217	i think the fx are clear in what we think of as the interest-rate-sensitive sectors, the ones i mentioned.
2019-10-31 02:58:44.690439	have.
2019-10-31 02:59:05.807315	has the fed thought about in some of his input from people you don' t always hear from, things like the beige book focus on businesses? is there thought of bringing in folks from community groups regularly? mr. powell: we think the fed listens as been a great success for us.
2019-10-31 02:59:16.557555	i would imagine that this entire monetary policy will become i would say this.
2019-10-31 02:59:48.059793	in the beige book, we talked to educational institutions, health care institutions, community labor groups, and all those groups are represented on the boards of our regional banks, also meet we also meet regularly at the with representatives of low and moderate income communities, we are very conscious that we represent all americans, and need to hear all their perspectives.
2019-10-31 02:59:54.539955	we talk about how low the unemployment rate is, the aggregate unemployment, but also talk about groups that haven' t experienced that yet read so we remind ourselves we serve everybody.

2019-10-31 03:00:05.790818	you mentioned housing and gdp data.
2019-10-31 03:00:40.292817	it, but that is our outlook, and we feel like our current stance of policy is appropriate, as long as that remains broadly outlook.
2019-10-31 03:00:46.542612	reporter: donna with cnn.
2019-10-31 03:01:15.042706	setting aside market expectations for today' s rate cut, 90% expected this today, can you tell us more about the rationale behind moving at this meeting as opposed to waiting six weeks and cutting in december, and if there was discussion about that around table? chairman powell: i think this seems to be the right moment.
2019-10-31 03:01:23.562640	we had our usual range of perspectives, range of views, but in the end we had a strong vote in favor of this action.
2019-10-31 03:01:25.578663	i strongly believe it is the right action.
2019-10-31 03:01:35.545909	the actions we have taken over the course of this year have been the right things for this economy and are supporting economic growth, and will do in the future.
2019-10-31 03:01:43.563238	reporter: greg rob from market watch.
2019-10-31 03:01:54.543304	it seems all across the country that different regions are reacting differently to china trade.
2019-10-31 03:02:32.063212	that out in one of our recent monetary policy reports to congress, the rural-urban disparities in employment, growth, all kinds of things, health outcomes.
2019-10-31 03:02:37.065612	it is a big and growing set of differences.
2019-10-31 03:03:12.334855	and those are issues that may have that may have to be addressed by legislatures and at the level.
2019-10-31 03:03:16.834610	reporter: can i follow-up quickly? are you asking congress to do something now, or will you ask them down the road? chairman powell: i' m not congress to do anything right now.
2019-10-31 03:03:23.568615	i sometimes have noted that it would be appropriate -- i will put it this way.
2019-10-31 03:03:34.035430	we do what we do, we are assigned a job, which is employment and stable prices, do stability and bank regulation.
2019-10-31 03:03:49.102062	the u.s. economy faces significant, longer-term challenges around labor participation, around disparities in income and wealth come around all kinds of and those are issues for congress.
2019-10-31 03:03:50.552097	they are not issues for us.
2019-10-31 03:04:52.304816	times.'' you said trade and specifically the prospects for a phase i agreement with china, the ups and downs of the trade dispute, several truces and tentative deals have fallen through, are you concerned monetary policy guidance, if will, that is dependent in part on whims of the trade negotiators? chairman powell: that is not i would characterize it.
2019-10-31 03:05:03.804709	i noted that it may be that there has been progress there, away from bad outcomes and confrontational outcomes.
2019-10-31 03:05:06.818803	it seems like there is the makings of a possible settlement there.
2019-10-31 03:05:11.787715	i didn' t say we are baking that in order an'hing, but i am noting that is the case.
2019-10-31 03:05:32.806372	as with brexit, it is uncertain what will be the result of the election and the ultimate result will be, but i would say the tail risk of a non-negotiated no deal brexit seems to have decreased, just as i would say the situation in our trade negotiations with china seems have taken a step closer to resolution.
2019-10-31 03:05:33.320105	that is all i am saying.
2019-10-31 03:05:54.820930	reporter: if it doesn' t work out, would we then be back at monetary policy that -- chairman powell: that is one factor among many, many that factor into our of the outlook.
2019-10-31 03:06:14.553815	if things happen that cause us to material reassess the outlook, change our of the outlook in a material way, then we would act accordingly.
2019-10-31 03:06:20.041649	reporter: agence france presse.
2019-10-31 03:06:50.557270	as has been pointed out, rising inequality and how that could a factor behind sluggish in light of the recent outcome of the strike at general motors, do you see the union having a role to play, helping to raise lower and middle incomes and promoting more shared chairman powell: not for us to say what the appropriate dbor arrangements will be.
2019-10-31 03:07:05.809966	i will just say, on the general motors strike, it is likely to have taken away a couple of tenths of growth this quarter.
2019-10-31 03:07:09.042869	that is likely to come back may be in the first quarter of next year.
2019-10-31 03:07:11.076566	i think it is good to see it settled.
2019-10-31 03:07:59.041009	accommodative, or just the neutral was lower than we thought at this time last year and secondly, we are now two years removed from the tax and jobs act, and the economy growing at about the same pace before -- same pace as before, about 2%.
2019-10-31 03:08:22.812890	given your mention of fiscal policy in the rolet plays in supporting long-term growth, it fair to say that the tax cuts and jobs act worked the way it was supposed to? chairman powell: sagan what first question was -- say again what your first question was? yes.
2019-10-31 03:08:31.064627	if you look at federal funds trading, it should be in the lower half of the range from to 175.
2019-10-31 03:08:35.061018	that means the real rate is probably modestly below zero.
2019-10-31 03:08:49.046539	my own sense would be that is somewhat accommodative i would say though, there is a range of plausible estimates on what the neutral rate of interest is.
2019-10-31 03:09:06.547416	and i think many who make such estimates have moved their estimate down over the course many years, and that process continues, but nonetheless that seems to me to be very likely an accommodative stance of and an appropriate stance given the situation we are and with continued downside risks.

2019-10-31 03:09:18.310806	i wanted to ask about financial stability risks.
2019-10-31 03:09:24.069964	recently the imf and other global policymakers have been expressing concerns over the high level of corporate debt.
2019-10-31 03:09:28.547979	as rates get lower in the u.s.
2019-10-31 03:09:39.564276	and around the world, are you more worried about financial stability risks? chairman powell: we monitor financial stability risks very carefully all the time.
2019-10-31 03:09:42.813612	it is what we do since the financial crisis.
2019-10-31 03:10:12.979757	financial sector.
2019-10-31 03:10:20.581813	if you like at asset prices, we see some high asset prices, but not broadly across a range.
2019-10-31 03:10:22.565895	we don' t see bubbles and kind of thing.
2019-10-31 03:10:30.065490	and that leaves the fourth, leverage and the nonfinancial sector, and that is households and businesses.
2019-10-31 03:10:38.833377	with households, we don' t see leverage, we see them actually getting in very good shape financially in the agri-desk in the aggregate.
2019-10-31 03:10:43.812642	plenty of households are not in great shape, but in the aggregate the household is in very good place.
2019-10-31 03:11:17.534028	shared national credit exams, and we have been monitoring it carefully and taking action.
2019-10-31 03:11:23.048868	reporter: nancy with marketplace.
2019-10-31 03:11:45.301551	have the problems in the repo market lead you to looking to other liquidity and capital reouirements for banks, that too high? is that something the fed might review? chairman powell: i think the most important, basic think is to get the level of reserves backup.
2019-10-31 03:11:50.282120	-- reserves back up.
2019-10-31 03:11:54.052053	reserves move up and down volatility.
2019-10-31 03:12:08.534320	we don' t want them to move the level they were at in september, between s1 .4 trillion and s1.5 trillion, that is the main thing and we are on a path to do that between our market operations and our bill purchases.
2019-10-31 03:12:15.303014	in addition to that, it is a big, complicated marketplace.
2019-10-31 03:12:45.489547	don' t think so.
2019-10-31 03:12:57.317683	where it may go, though, is to look at for example intraday liquidity, which used to be a common thing, common thing banks to have intraday liquidity from the fed, what are called daylight overdrafts.
2019-10-31 03:12:59.302482	that is something we can look at.
2019-10-31 03:13:29.459862	or financial stability.
2019-10-31 03:13:30.789392	reporter: thank you, chairman powell.
2019-10-31 03:13:33.788906	i' m from a japanese newspaper.
2019-10-31 03:13:51.554909	given the same level of low inflation, even in this country, there seems to be a higher possibility that lower inflation expectation will remain going forward.
2019-10-31 03:14:07.557978	do you think if a japan-like situation, chronically low inflation and interest, the u.s.
2019-10-31 03:14:19.608317	is getting trumped by their japanification of this situation? chairman powell: we have the situation in japan, and now the situation in europe.
2019-10-31 03:14:27.342406	and we note there are significant disinflationary pressures around the world, we don' t think we are exempt from those.
2019-10-31 03:14:36.625082	but if you look at your current inflation performance, it been anything like what we have seen in those other places.
2019-10-31 03:14:41.842863	but again, we don' t think we exempt from those pressures.
2019-10-31 03:14:52.576692	we are therefore strongly committed to having inflation expectations anchored at a that is consistent with asymmetric 2% inflation objective.
2019-10-31 03:14:57.090396	that is what we are committed to, and will use our tools to achieve.
2019-10-31 03:14:58.591729	so we take the risk very seriously.
2019-10-31 03:15:40.811798	what we can now to mold and really move inflation expectations up, so that they are squarely and firmly at a level that is consistent with 2% inflation.

2019-10-31 03:16:02.793937	a balance sheet question, not necessarily on the repo crunch, there was discussion that may the fed should move to a balance sheet, removing agency backed mortgage securities on the balance sheet and maybe replace them with shorter-term treasuries.
2019-10-31 03:16:12.327968	i have not heard an update on the composure or composition the balance sheet for right i' m wondering if the fed is actively thinking about that right now, and if so, when we might hear something on that.
2019-10-31 03:16:17.045695	chairman powell: it is an issue, but not an issue we are currently working on.
2019-10-31 03:16:48.314334	of not commenting on any elected official would say, but thank you.
2019-10-31 03:17:18.483748	direction.
2019-10-31 03:17:24.798198	stocks are higher, the s>p 500 at an all-time high, bonds or higher, yields down, gold is higher, the dollar weakens.
2019-10-31 03:17:54.969133	dominant word.
2019-10-31 03:17:57.833871	what is appropriate to say is there are a number of themes to talk about.
